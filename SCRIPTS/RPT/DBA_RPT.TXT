		  (requires a table to be created and loaded: disk_controller see script)

lstfiles		Lists all files for the DB except the init.ora.  Usefull to check backup strategies.

		  (suitable for re-creating the object from this report)

roles		All roles that exist in the Database
rolepriv		Description of roles granted to users and to roles
reltbls		Attempts to match tables and columns to unique index definitions 
		  (good for v6 to v7 transition to determine foreign key constraints that 
		  should be defined.  Also this is a good report for developers that need 
		  to know how a column is referenced (the foreign column name) in another table.

< cmp_exts.txt lists the procedure >
bef_aftr		Shows before and after picture for coallescing operation prior to performing
cntg_tbl		Creates a table of contiguous space which is a candidate for coallescing

		  to coallesce the free space
fragindx		Fragmentation index for a tablespace
mapper		Maps object positions and freespace for a tablespace.

	---- ORACLE Financials  utils  ----
lstcnapp		List Defined Applications and programs for the Concurrent Manager
lstcncon		List Conflicts for either running Concurrent programs or all Concurrent programs
