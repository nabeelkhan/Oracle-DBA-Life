Notes on using index.xls spread sheet:

This is an Excell spread sheet for doing index sizing. It isn’t pretty and doesn’t have 
alot of bells and whistles but should do the job. You enter the table name, Index name, 
Percent filled for non-unique indexes (we recommend 70%), blocksize, Pctfree and the 
initrans and number of rows as the base line information. Then, you enter each column 
and its size, be sure to allow for number columns as n/2. The spread sheet automatically 
calculates number of blocks and the size in either M - Meg, or k - Kilobytes.
