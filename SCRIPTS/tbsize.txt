Using the sizing spreadsheet (TBSIZE.XLS):

The sizing spreadsheet is an Excell based spreadsheet. It can 
calculate the size for up to 20 columns of each type (1 byte 
header, 3 byte header, Date and Number). It includes overhead 
for multiple transactions as determined by inittrans*23. 
If this is for a cluster this data is also enterable, 
otherwise it defaults to 1. The standard value for 57 
is used for the fixed header. 

Only enter data in the Table, 1Byte Sz, # byte Sz, Date 
and Number columns. The other columns are calculated. 
The date is set to 7+1 (8) bytes no matter what you enter, 
so just enter a 1 for each date column. An average value of 
11 for length of the date field is used for the 
flat file (FFS) calculation.

You need to enter your DB Bk Sz (DB Block Size), the value for 
inittrans, pctfree and number of tables in cluster (if needed) 
and the # of ROW values. The spread sheet calculates intial 
Rows per Blocks not using the 2*rpb value and then a final rpb 
based on that number. The sizes calculated for both rpb numbers 
are reported in either m (meg) or k (kilobytes) and an average 
is taken. This should be close enough for sizing estimates 
(usually the first and second sizes are within a few precent 
of each other).

Also included is a filled out spread sheet (EXAMPLE.XLS) to 
show what it looks like.
