   
                 Welcome to InstantScripts!

   InstantScripts has over two hundred ready-made scripts for 
   your Oracle administration needs.  These scripts cover all 
   aspects of day-to-day Oracle administration, from installation 
   to system monitoring and backup and recovery. The scripts are 
   divided into eight categories to make finding scripts to suit 
   your particular needs fast and easy. 

   Using the search function, you can find a particular script 
   even faster. With a mouse click, you can view the entire script,
   and even flip back and forth between scripts.  InstantScripts 
   also allows you to view the properties of each script.
   
   Not only can you use the ready-made Knowledge Xpert scripts, you 
   can also copy them to create your own custom, User scripts.  User 
   scripts can be modified and fine-tuned to suit your specific needs.  
   InstantScripts stores the User scripts with the Knowledge Xpert 
   scripts (and even sorts them to the top of their appropriate 
   categories).  With InstantScripts, there is no more hunting around 
   on your hard drive for your favorite and important scripts!
