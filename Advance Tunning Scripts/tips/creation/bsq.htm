				Customizing SQL.BSQ
			</font>
		</h2>
		Most DBAs are reluctant to customize the <em>sql.bsq</em> file prior to database creation, in the belief that doing so is unsupported.
		However, since release 7.3, limited customization of the <em>sql.bsq</em> file has been supported.
		You may still see comments to the contrary, even from within Oracle.
		However, the <em>Tuning</em> guide of the official Oracle documentation set
		allows that modifications may be made to the <em>sql.bsq</em> file to optimize the physical storage of the data dictionary.
		You may not, however, modify the logical structure of the data dictionary.
		<p>
		We strongly recommend that you take the opportunity to customize the <em>sql.bsq</em> file
		prior to the creation of any performance critical database.
		A failure to do so will introduce problems that can only be repaired by recreating the database.
		But before you can make your changes to <em>sql.bsq</em>, you need to consider to the following question.
		
		<h3>
			<font color="#660066">
				How can you prevent fragmentation of the SYSTEM tablespace?
			</font>
		</h3>
		The control of space within the SYSTEM tablespace is particularly difficult because it is used in diverse and mysterious ways.
		However, of all tablespaces the SYSTEM tablespace is the most important one in which to avoid fragmentation,
		because repairing such damage normally involves rebuilding the database.
		<p>
		I scarcely need repeat the cardinal rule that other than the data dictionary
		<em>nothing</em> should be allowed in the SYSTEM tablespace that can possibly go elsewhere.
		In particular, no user, other than SYS, should have SYSTEM as their DEFAULT TABLESPACE.
		And no user, not even SYS, should have SYSTEM as their TEMPORARY TABLESPACE.
		You can use the APT script <b><a href="../../scripts/misc.htm#system_space_invaders">system_space_invaders.sql</a></b> to identify any such users.
		<p>
		Despite all such warnings, the creation of extraneous segments in the SYSTEM tablespace
		is still the main cause of SYSTEM tablespace fragmentation.
		Scripts such as Oracle's <em>utlbstat.sql</em> and <em>utlestat.sql</em>
		that create and drop segments in the SYS schema's default tablespace don't help.
		<p>
		Of course, there are some things that go into the SYSTEM tablespace that you cannot control -
		namely, the data dictionary, the SYSTEM rollback segment and deferred rollback segments.
		<blockquote>
			<small>
				It is actually possible to place much of the data dictionary in another tablespace, and there is sometimes good reason for doing so.
				However, if you do need to do anything like this, you should get Oracle's blessing first.
			</small>
		</blockquote>
		The data dictionary segments have very diverse storage requirement, however these are basically static in mature databases.
		The SYSTEM rollback segment should be lightly used, and thus not require much space management.
		But deferred rollback segments are the wildcards in SYSTEM tablespace space management.
		<p>
		Deferred rollback segments are also called <em>save undo</em> segments.
		They are created automatically if a tablespace goes offline with uncommitted changes.
		Normally, this will only happen in the event of media failure, and only if your database is in archivelog mode.
		One deferred rollback segment is created for each tablespace affected.
		Each transaction affected copies the undo records for changes to that tablespace only,
		from the rollback segment to which it has been writing, into the deferred rollback segment.
		When the tablespace comes back online again, the undo from transactions that were rolled back is automatically applied,
		and the deferred rollback segment is dropped.
		<p>
		Deferred rollback segments are created in the SYSTEM tablespace explicitly (not in the SYS schema's default tablespace, if that has been changed).
		So you need to allow space in the SYSTEM tablespace for deferred rollback segments.
		There must be at least enough space to accommodate all the outstanding undo
		against any set of tablespaces that may go offline together due to a single media failure.
		<p>
		The most unpleasant thing about the creation of deferred rollback segments
		is that they do not use the SYSTEM tablespace's default INITIAL and NEXT extent sizes, but instead specify tiny 10K extents.
		However, they do use the SYSTEM tablespace's default PCTINCREASE value.
		This seems calculated to defeat most attempts to actively manage space in the SYSTEM tablespace.
		If you change the default PCTINCREASE value for the SYSTEM tablespace to zero, deferred rollback segments will be created in lots of tiny extents.
		Deferred rollback segments, like the SYSTEM rollback segment, cannot have an unlimited number of extents.
		The number of extents is limited by the number of slots in the extent control table in the segment header block.
		To avoid data loss, you must ensure that that limit is never reached for a deferred rollback segment.
		<p>
		This means that you have to choose between the following three options for SYSTEM tablespace space management.
		<ol>
			<li>
			You can (in theory) make SYSTEM a locally managed tablespace using the AUTOALLOCATE policy
			(the UNIFORM SIZE policy is not available for the SYSTEM tablespace).
			<li>
			You can make SYSTEM a dictionary managed tablespace with a fixed extent size policy.
			In this case the PCTINCREASE value would be zero, but the extent size would be large enough
			to prevent any risk of being unable to extend a deferred rollback segment.
			<li>
			You can make SYSTEM a dictionary managed tablespace with a non-zero PCTINCREASE value
			and rely on the MINIMUM EXTENT size feature to limit fragmentation.
			(This feature is not available prior to Oracle8; but nobody should be creating Oracle7 databases anymore.)
		</ol>
		<p>
		It is not recommended that you make SYSTEM a locally managed tablespace.
		Extent information for locally managed tablespaces is not cached in the dictionary cache,
		and in the case of the data dictionary itself this caching is important to the performance of rowcache recursive SQL.
		(Not to mention that database creation fails if you attempt this anyway unless you've made extensive changes to <em>sql.bsq</em>.)
		<p>
		We also prefer not to use a large fixed extent size for the SYSTEM tablespace.
		Most of the short-term segments created in the SYSTEM tablespace have very modest space requirements,
		and using a large fixed extent size is inefficient in terms of space.
		<p>
		We therefore recommend that the data dictionary be created initially with default extent sizes,
		and that fragmentation be controlled by applying a MINIMUM EXTENT size to the SYSTEM tablespace
		immediately after database creation, as follows:
		<blockquote>
			<samp>
				alter tablespace system minimum extent 64K;
			</samp>
		</blockquote>
		The MINIMUM EXTENT size adopted should be exactly one multiblock read.
		
		<h3>

				Why create databases twice?
			</font>
		</h3>
		But we don't recommend that you leave it there.
		In fact, we recommend that you create all performance critical databases twice.
		This first time is just for practice and to take some measurements, so that you can do it perfectly the second time.
		<p>
		Doing it perfectly the second time involves some customization of the <em>sql.bsq</em> file as foreshadowed at the beginning of this tip.
		Firstly, do not touch the <em>sql.bsq</em> file that comes with your Oracle distribution
		(in <em>$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin</em>, or in <em>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs</em>).
		Copy that file to your database creation directory, and edit the copy instead.
		To use your customized <em>sql.bsq</em> file when recreating the database, you will need to set the <em>_init_sql_file</em> parameter.
		<p>
		The most important thing to change in the <em>sql.bsq</em> file is the SIZE clause of the primary data dictionary clusters,
		C_OBJ# and C_FILE#_BLOCK#.
		By default, C_OBJ# is sized for tables with 10 columns and 2 indexes over 2 columns each.
		Tables with significantly more columns and/or heavier indexing than this will cause cluster block chaining in this cluster unless you prevent it.
		C_FILE#_BLOCK# is sized for segments with only 5 extents.
		Segments in dictionary managed tablespaces with significantly more than 5 extents
		will cause cluster block chaining in this cluster unless you customize the SIZE clause.
		<p>
		To get the SIZE clauses right, we recommend that you use the APT script <b><a href="../../scripts/dd.htm#dd_cluster_sizes">dd_cluster_sizes.sql</a></b>.
		This script requires that you first create all the database objects that will be required for the application,
		and extend them to their estimated stable number of extents, if using dictionary managed tablespaces.
		The script then measures the average space usage per cluster key in the relevant data dictionary clusters,
		and makes a recommendation for the SIZE clauses.
		<p>
		Since you are going to be editing the <em>sql.bsq</em> file, you also have the opportunity to set appropriate INITIAL and NEXT extent sizes
		for all the data dictionary segments that might otherwise immediately require multiple extents.
		Indeed, you must for the clusters if you have customized their SIZE clauses, otherwise database creation is likely to fail.
		First, you need to ensure that the data dictionary of your trial database is fully populated,
		by running all the required catalog scripts, loading all the required optional packages,
		loading all the stored program units for your application, creating all the users, and analyzing all the segments.
		You can then use the APT script <b><a href="../../scripts/dd.htm#dd_initial_extents">dd_initial_extents.sql</a></b>
		to get recommended sizes for the INITIAL and NEXT extents for these segments, and edit you copy of <em>sql.bsq</em> accordingly.
		<p>
		On more thing that you can fruitfully do at this point is to run <b><a href="../../scripts/io_opt.htm#row_migration">row_migration.sql</a></b>
		to check for row migration problems in the data dictionary, and adopt the suggested PCTFREE settings, if any.
		The last thing to check before you actually create the database again,
		is that you have allowed enough free space in the SYSTEM tablespace for the dynamic creation of deferred rollback segments if necessary.
