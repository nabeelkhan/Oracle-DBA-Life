/ Message Standards    
/ =================
/ Author  Brian Quigley
/ Written 07/28/92
/ 
/ Purpose
/ -------
/   When a message is generated, you are speaking directly to the user.  Often,
/ the quality of your software is judged by the ease with which a user can fix
/ problems.  Your purpose is to make it as easy as possible to use Oracle
/ products. 
/ 
/   Note that the "Cause:" and "Action:" sections for a message will also be 
/ seen by the user.  Thus, it is important to keep these sections simple, yet
/ as helpful as possible. 
/ 
/   Whenever possible, include all relevant information within the message.
/ 
/   Your purpose is to make a message as informative as possible.
/ 
/ Size Of Message
/ ---------------
/   Message text should be limited to a maximum of 76 characters. Messages
/ containing embedded % directives should not overrun the 76 character limit
/ unless they signal unusual errors which do not occur as part of user
/ applications.  For example, startup errors and system-dependent errors can
/ probably may have longer message text. 
/
/ 
/ Simple Language
/ ---------------
/   Avoid cryptic messages and overly technical language.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: index key does not exist root dba %s, dba %s (%s)
/     BETTER  : index key does not exist for row: %s, %s, %s
/ 
/ 
/ Lowercase vs. Uppercase
/ -----------------------
/   Use uppercase for commands and keywords.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: alter cluster statement no longer supported
/     BETTER  : ALTER CLUSTER statement no longer supported
/ 
/ 
/   Use lowercase in the message wording, including the first letter.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: Invalid syntax
/     BETTER  : invalid syntax
/ 
/ 
/ Commands, Keywords, Parameters Values
/ -------------------------------------
/   Whenever possible, give the command, keyword, and parameter values that the
/ user used. 
/ 
/   Use uppercase to indicate commands and keywords.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: missing IDENTIFIED keyword
/     BETTER  : GRANT CONNECT statement requires the IDENTIFIED keyword
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: MAXVALUE is less than current value
/     BETTER  : ALTER SEQUENCE MAXVALUE %s is less than current MAXVALUE %s
/ 
/ 
/ Period
/ ------
/   Do not end a message with a period.
/ 
/ 
/ Numbers
/ -------
/   Do not enclose numbers with special characters.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: number of control files (%s) does not equal %s
/     BETTER  : specified %s control files while other instances have %s
/ 
/   Spell out the word "number" to ensure the message is understood.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: change %s for thread (%s) is in sequence #%s
/     BETTER  : the change number %s for thread %s is in sequence number %s
/ 
/ 
/ Numbers - User Input
/ --------------------
/   Do not enclose user-input numbers with special characters.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: file size (%s) exceeds maximum of %s blocks
/     BETTER  : a file size of %s would exceed the allowed maximum of %s blocks
/ 
/ 
/ Quotes
/ ------
/   Do not use single or double quotes to highlight a text variable or command.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: 'row_locking = always' requires transaction processing 
/     BETTER  : ROW_LOCKING = ALWAYS requires transaction processing 
/ 
/ 
/ Single Quotes
/ -------------
/   Never use single quotes.
/ 
/ 
/ Double Quotes
/ -------------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use double quotes to identify database objects.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: file %s: bad block size "% bytes" expecting "%s"
/     BETTER  : expected block size of %s bytes in file "%s" but found %s
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: duplicate column %s
/     BETTER  : duplicate column "%s" specified for table "%s", schema "%s"
/ 
/ 
/ Ellipses
/ --------
/   Never use ellipses.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: datatype {%s} for column %s, table %s.%s is not supported
/     BETTER  : datatype %s not support for column "%s" table "%s" schema "%s"
/ 
/ 
/ Parentheses
/ -----------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use parentheses for identifying constraint names.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: unique constraint %s.%s violated
/     BETTER  : unique constraint (%s.%s) violated
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: invalid file size (%s)
/     BETTER  : size of %s bytes is invalid for file "%s"
/ 
/ 
/ Brackets
/ --------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use brackets for identifying program argument values.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: Internal Error: %s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s
/     BETTER  : internal error, arguments: [%s],[%s],[%s],[%s],[%s],[%s]
/ 
/ 
/ Grammar
/ ------
/    Use complete sentences whenever possible (but no period at end of
/ sentence).
/ 
/    Use not use multiple sentences in a message, i.e. one sentence only.
/ 
/    Use the active voice.
/ 
/    Do not use an antagonistic tone.
/ 
/    Use correct punctuation whenever possible.
/ 
/ 
/ Recommended Style
/ ---------------------
/   Try to make positive recommendations or suggestions as part of the message.
/ 
/   Explain what is invalid AND what is valid.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: invalid file size (%s)
/     BETTER  : file size of %s is invalid
/     BEST    : file size of %s bytes is outside valid range %s to %s bytes
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: duplicate column %s
/     GOOD    : duplicate column "%s" in %s
/     BEST    : duplicate column "%s" in %s "%s"
/                                        ^    ^
/                        this variable ...    ... this variable
/                   indicates the TYPE            indicates the NAME
/                   of database object            of the object
/ 
/ 
/   Thus, substituting ... 'colin', 'view'
/ 
/        in:    duplicate column "%s" in %s
/     gives:    duplicate column "colin" in view
/ 
/ 
/   And, substituting ... 'ugotit', 'primary, foreign or index key'
/ 
/        in:    duplicate column "%s" in %s
/     gives:    duplicate column "ugotit" in primary, foreign or index key
/ 
/   And, substituting ... 'pedestal', 'table', 'entablature'
/ 
/        in:    duplicate column "%s" in %s "%s"
/     gives:    duplicate column "pedestal" in table "entablature"
/ 
/   And substituting ... 'wat', 'dee', 'dikins'
/ 
/        in:    illegal constraint (%s.%s) for schema "%s"
/     gives:    illegal constraint (wat.dee) for schema "dikins"
/ 
/ 
/ Text Variables
/ --------------
/   Do not place text variables at the beginning of messages, as this does not 
/ allow correct alphabetical sorting of the messages.  The alphabetical listing
/ at the back of the Messages Manual is a necessary tool for Customer Support.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: %s not found
/     BETTER  : object %s not found
/     BEST    : object %s not found in schema %s
/ 
/ 
/ Internal Errors & Routine Names
/ -------------------------------
/   Use ORA-00600 messages for internal messages not to be seen by the user.
/ 
/   Do not use routine names in messages.
/ 
/     NOT GOOD: ORA-03116, ttcxxx: invalid buffer length
/     BETTER  : ORA-00600, internal error, arguments: [ttcxxx], [], [], [], []
/ 
/ 
/ Public vs. Non Public Messages 
/ ------------------------------
/   Use ORA-00600 messages for internal messages not to be seen by the user.
/ 
/   For messages which are for internal use only, indicate this in ERROR.MSG
/ message listing or at beginning of the range of this type of message in the
/ file. Debug event codes, CORE messages, are examples. 
/ 
/   Use "// *Document: NO" as follows:
/ 
/   e.g. 
/       10049, 00000, "protect library cache memory heaps"
/       // *Document: NO
/       // *Cause: 
/       // *Action: Use the OS memory protection (if available) to protect
/       //          library cache memory heaps that are pinned.
/ 
/ 
/ Programmer's Comments
/ ---------------------
/   If you wish to add comments regarding a message that should not be seen by
/ the public, use "// *Comment: " as follows:
/ 
/   e.g. 
/       32769, 00000, "incompatible SQL*Net version"
/       // *Cause: An attempt was made to use an older version of SQL*Net that
/       //         is incompatible with current version of ORACLE.
/       // *Action: Use a newer version of SQL*Net.
/       // *Comment: Can only happen if user tried to use an illegal copy of a 
/       //           pre-lease version of SQL*Net.
/ 
/ 
/ ORACLE vs. Oracle
/ -----------------
/    The word ORACLE in uppercase refers to the ORACLE server. Use the term
/ "ORACLE server" when referring to the server. 
/ 
/    The word Oracle in lowercase with capitalized first letter refers to the
/ company. Use "Oracle Corp." when referring to the company.
/

00000, 00000, "normal, successful completion"
// *Cause:  Normal exit
// *Action: None
00001, 00000, "unique constraint (%s.%s) violated"
// *Cause: An update or insert statement attempted to insert a duplicate key
//         For Trusted ORACLE configured in DBMS MAC mode, you may see
//         this message if a duplicate entry exists at a different level.
// *Action: Either remove the unique restriction or do not insert the key

/
/ 10 - 49 user session and session switching errors
/
00017, 00000, "session requested to set trace event"
// *Cause:  The current session was requested to set a trace event by another
//          session.
// *Action: This is used internally, no action required.
00018, 00000, "maximum number of sessions exceeded"
// *Cause:  All session state objects are in use
// *Action: Increase maximum sessions - init.ora parameter "sessions"
00019, 00000, "maximum number of session licenses exceeded"
// *Cause: All licenses are in use
// *Action: Increase number of session licenses
00020, 00000, "maximum number of processes (%s) exceeded"
// *Cause:  All process state objects are in use
// *Action: Increase  maximum processes - init.ora parameter "processes"
00021, 00000, "session attached to some other process; cannot switch session"
// *Cause:  The user session is currently used by others.
// *Action: Do not switch to a session attached to some other process
00022, 00000, "invalid session id; access denied"
// *Cause: Either the session specified does not exist or the caller
//         doesn't have to privilege to access it.
// *Action: Specify a valid session id that you have privilege to access, ie,
//          either you owns it or you have CHANGE_USER privilege.
00023, 00000, "session references process's private memory; cannot detach session"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to detach the current session when it contains
//          references to the process's private memory.
// *Action: A session may contain references to process memory (PGA) if it has
//          an open network connection, a very large context area, or operating
//          system privileges.  To allow the detach, it may be necessary to
//          close the session's database links and/or cursors.  Detaching a
//          session with operating system privileges is always disallowed.
00024, 00000, "logins from more than one process not allowed in single-process mode"
// *Cause:  trying to login more than once from different processes for
//           ORACLE started in single-process mode
// *Action: logoff from the other process
00025, 00000, "failed to allocate %s"
// *Cause:  out of memory
// *Action: restart with larger sga heap.
00026, 00000, "missing or invalid session id"
// *Cause:  Missing or invalid session id string for ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION.
// *Action: Retry with a valid session id.
00027, 00000, "cannot kill current session"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION to kill the current 
//          session.
// *Action: None.
00028, 00000, "your session has been killed"
// *Cause:  A privileged user has killed your session and you are no longer
//          logged on to the database. 
// *Action: Login again if you wish to continue working.
00029, 00000, "session is not a user session"
// *Cause:  The session id specified in an ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION command
//          was not a user session (e.g., recursive, etc).
// *Action: Retry with a user session id.
00030, 00000, "user session ID does not exist"
// *Cause:  The user session id no longer exists, probably because the
//          session was logged out.
// *Action: Use a valid session ID.
00031, 00000, "session marked for kill"
// *Cause:  The session specified in an ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION command
//          cannot be killed immediately (because it's rolling back or blocked
//          on a network operation), but it has been marked for kill.  This
//          means it will be killed as soon as possible after its current
//          uninterruptable operation is done.
// *Action: No action is required for the session to be killed, but further
//          executions of the ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION command on this session
//          may cause the session to be killed sooner.
00032, 00000, "invalid session migration password"
// *Cause:  The session migration password specified in a session creation
//          call was invalid (probably too long).
// *Action: Retry with a valid password, less than 30 chars.
00033, 00000, "current session has empty migration password"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to detach or clone the current session and
//          it has an empty migration password.  This is not allowed.
// *Action: Create the session with a non-empty migration password.
00034, 00000, "cannot %s in current PL/SQL session"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to issue a commit or rollback from a PL/SQL
//          object (procedure, function, package) in a session which has this
//          disabled (by 'alter session disable commit in procedure')
// *Action: enable commits from PL/SQL in this session, or don't attempt
//          to use commit or rollback in PL/SQL when they are disabled
//          in the current session.
00035, 00000, "LICENSE_MAX_USERS cannot be less than current number of users"
// *Cause:
// *Action:
00050, 00000, "O/S error occurred while obtaining an enqueue. See o/s error."
// *Cause:  Could not obtain the operating system resources necessary
//          to cover an oracle enqueue.  This is normally the result
//          of an o/s user quota that is too low.
// *Action: Look up the operating system error in your system documentation
//          and perform the needed action.
00051, 00000, "timeout occurred while waiting for resource"
// *Cause:  Usually due to a dead instance
// *Action: Check for any dead, unrecovered instances and recover them
00052, 00000, "maximum number of enqueue resources (%s) exceeded"
// *Cause:  Ran out of enqueue resources.
// *Action: Increase init.ora parameter "enqueue_resources"
00053, 00000, "maximum number of enqueues exceeded"
// *Cause:  Ran out of enqueue state objects
// *Action: Increase the number of enqueues - init.ora parameter "enqueues"
00054, 00000, "resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified"
// *Cause:  Resource interested is busy
// *Action: Retry if necessary
00055, 00000, "maximum number of DML locks exceeded"
// *Cause:  Ran out of DML lock state objects
// *Action: Increase the "dml_locks" init.ora parameter and warm start
00056, 00000, "DDL lock on object '%s.%s' is already held in an incompatible mode"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to acquire a ddl lock that is already locked
// *Action: This happens if you attempt to drop a table that has parse locks
//	    on it
00057, 00000, "maximum number of temporary table locks exceeded"
// *Cause:  The number of temporary tables equals or exceeds the number of
//          temporary table locks.  Temporary tables are often created by
//          large sorts.
// *Action: Increase the "temporary_table_locks" init.ora parameter and 
//          warm start.
00058, 00000, "DB_BLOCK_SIZE must be %s to mount this database (not %s)"
// *Cause:  DB_BLOCK_SIZE init.ora parameter is wrong for the database
//          being mounted. It does not match the value used to create the
//          database.
// *Action: fix the DB_BLOCK_SIZE parameter or mount a database that matches
00059, 00000, "maximum number of DB_FILES exceeded"
// *Cause:  DB_FILE init.ora parameter exceeded
// *Action: Increase the DB_FILES parameter and warm start.
00060, 00000, "deadlock detected while waiting for resource"
// *Cause:  Transactions deadlock one another waiting for resources
// *Action: Look at the trace file to see the transactions and resources
//          involved. Retry if necessary.
00061, 00000, "another instance has a different DML_LOCKS setting"
// *Cause: The shared instance being started is using dml locks, and the
//	   running instances are not, or vice-versa.
// *Action: Ensure that all instances' init.ora files specify the dml_locks
//	    parameter 0 or all as non-zero
00062, 00000, "DML full-table lock cannot be acquired; DML_LOCKS is 0"
// *Cause: The instance was started with dml_locks = 0, and the statement
//	   being executed needs a full-table lock (S, X, or SSX).
// *Action: Restart the instance with dml_locks not zero, and reexecute
//	    the statement.
00063, 00000, "maximum number of LOG_FILES exceeded"
// *Cause:  LOG_FILES init.ora parameter exceeded
// *Action: Increase the LOG_FILES parameter and warm start. The parameter
//          needs to be as large as the highest number log that currently
//          exists rather than just the count of logs that exist.
00064, 00000, "object is too large to allocate on this O/S (%s,%s)"
// *Cause:  An init.ora parameter was set to a value that required allocating
//          more contiguous space than can be allocated on this Operating
//          System.
// *Action: Reduce the value of the init.ora parameter.
00065, 00000, "initialization of FIXED_DATE failed"
// *Cause:  fixed_date string not in date format yyyy-mm-dd:hh24:mi:ss
// *Action: ensure the init.ora parameter is in correct date format
00066, 00000, "LOG_FILES is %s but needs to be %s to be compatible"
// *Cause:  The maximum number of log files supported by this instance 
//         is not the same as for the other instances. All instances must
//         be able to open all the files any instance can open.
// *Action: Change the value of the LOG_FILES parameter to be compatible
00067, 00000, "invalid value %s for parameter %s, must be at least %s"
// *Cause:  The value for the initialization parameter is invalid.
// *Action: Choose a value as indicated by the message.
00068, 00000, "invalid value %s for parameter %s, must be between %s and %s"
// *Cause:  The value for the initialization parameter is invalid.
// *Action: Choose a value as indicated by the message.
00069, 00000, "cannot acquire lock -- table locks disabled for %s" 
// *Cause: A command was issued that tried to lock the table indicated in 
//         the message. Examples of commands that can lock tables are: 
//         LOCK TABLE, ALTER TABLE ... ADD (...), and so on. 
// *Action: Use the ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE TABLE LOCK command, and retry 
//          the command. 
/
/ 70 .. 95 generic debugger errors
/
00070, 00000, "command %s is not valid"
// *Cause:  An invalid debugger command was specified.
// *Action: Type HELP to see the list of available commands.
00071, 00000, "process number must be between 1 and %s"
// *Cause:  An invalid process number was specified.
// *Action: Specify a valid process number.
00072, 00000, "process \"%s\" is not active"
// *Cause:  An invalid process was specified.
// *Action: Specify a valid process.
00073, 00000, "command %s takes between %s and %s argument(s)"
// *Cause:  An incorrect number of arguments was specified.
// *Action: Specify the correct number of arguments.  Type HELP
//          to see the list of commands and their syntax.
00074, 00000, "no process has been specified"
// *Cause:  No debug process has been specified.
// *Action: Specify a valid process.
00075, 00000, "process \"%s\" not found in this instance"
// *Cause:  The specified process was not logged on to the current instance.
// *Action: Specify a valid process.
00076, 00000, "dump %s not found"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to invoke a dump which doesn't exist.
// *Action: Type DUMPLIST to see the list of available dumps.
00077, 00000, "dump %s is not valid"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to invoke an invalid dump.
// *Action: Try another dump.
00078, 00000, "cannot dump variables by name"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to dump a variable by name on a system which
//          does not support this feature.
// *Action: Try the PEEK command.
00079, 00000, "variable %s not found"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to dump a variable which doesn't exist.
// *Action: Use a valid variable name.
00080, 00000, "invalid global area specified by level %s"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to dump an invalid global area.
// *Action: Use level 1 for the PGA, 2 for the SGA, and 3 for the UGA.
//          Use <extra + level> to dump global area <level> as well as <extra>
//          bytes for every pointer; <extra> must be a multiple of 4.
00081, 00000, "address range [%s, %s) is not readable"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to read/write an invalid memory address range.
// *Action: Try another address or length.
00082, 00000, "memory size of %s is not in valid set of [1], [2], [4]%s%s%s%s%s"
// *Cause:  An invalid length was specified for the POKE command.
// *Action: Use a valid length (either 1, 2, 4, or possibly 8).
00083, 00000, "warning: possibly corrupt SGA mapped"
// *Cause:  Even though there may be SGA corruptions, the SGA was mapped.
// *Action: Use the "dumpsga" command to dump the SGA.
00084, 00000, "global area must be PGA, SGA, or UGA"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to dump an invalid global area.
// *Action: Specify either PGA, SGA, or UGA.
00085, 00000, "current call does not exist"
// *Cause:  An invalid attempt was made to dump the current call heap.
// *Action: Wait until the process starts a call.
00086, 00000, "user call does not exist"
// *Cause:  An invalid attempt was made to dump the user call heap.
// *Action: Wait until the process starts a call.
00097, 00000, "Use of Oracle SQL feature not in SQL92 %s Level"
// *Cause: Usage of Oracle's SQL extensions.
// *Action: 
00100, 00000, "no data found"
// *Cause: An application made reference to unknown or inaccessible data.
// *Action: Handle this condition within the application or make appropriate
//          modifications to the application code.
//             NOTE: If the application uses Oracle-mode SQL instead of
//             ANSI-mode SQL,ORA-01403 will be generated instead of ORA-00100.
/
/ 101 .. 149 multi-threaded server errors
/
00101, 00000, "invalid specification for system parameter mts_dispatchers"
// *Cause: The syntax for the "mts_dispatchers" parameter is incorrect.
// *Action: refer to the manual for correct syntax.
00102, 00000, "network protocol %s cannot be used by dispatchers"
// *Cause: The network specified in "mts_dispatchers" doesn't have the
//         functionalities required by the dispatchers.
// *Action: refer to the manual on network protocols supported by the
//          dispatchers.
00103, 00000, "invalid network protocol; reserved for use by dispatchers"
// *Cause: The network specified in sql*net connect string is reserved
//         for use by the dispatchers.
// *Action: specify other network protocols in the connection string
00104, 00000, "deadlock detected; all public servers blocked waiting for resources"
// *Cause: All available public servers are servicing requests that requires
//         resources locked by a client which is unable to get a public
//         server to release the resources.
// *Action: increase the limit for the system parameter "mts_max_servers"
//          as the system will automaticaly start
//          up new servers to break the deadlock until the number of
//          servers reaches the value specified in "mts_max_servers".
00105, 00000, "dispatching mechanism not configured for network protocol %s"
// *Cause: trying to alter the dispatcher's configuration for a network
//         protocol not specified in init.ora file.
// *Action: Need to include the network protocol in the system parameter
//          "mts_dispatchers" in init.ora and re-start the system.
00106, 00000, "cannot startup/shutdown database when connected to a dispatcher"
//  *Cause: An attempt was made to startup/shutdown database when connected to 
//          a shared server via a dispatcher.
// *Action: Re-connect as user INTERNAL without going through the dispatcher.
//          For most cases, this can be done by connect to INTERNAL without
//          specifying a network connect string.
00107, 00000, "failed to connect to ORACLE listener process"
// *Cause: Most likely due to the fact that ORACLE listener hasn't been
// 	   started up.
// *Action: start up ORACLE listener if it hasn't been started up. Else
//	    contact your ORACLE representative.
00108, 00000, "failed to set up dispatcher to accept connection asynchronously"
// *Cause: Most likely due to the fact that the network protocol used by the
//	   the dispatcher doesn't support aynchronous operations.
// *Action: contact your ORACLE representative.
00111, 00000, "maximum number of servers is only %s; adding %s servers"
// *Cause: An attempt was made to start up more servers than the maximum
//         number specified by the system parameter "mts_max_servers".
// *Action: Increase the value of "mts_max_servers" in init.ora as needed.
00112, 00000, "only created up to %s (maximum specified) dispatchers"
// *Cause: An attempt was made to start up more dispatchers than the maximum
//         number specified by the system parameter "mts_max_dispatchers".
// *Action: Increase the value of "mts_max_dispatchers" in init.ora as needed.
00113, 00000, "protocol name %s is too long"
// *Cause: A protocol name specified in the "mts_dispatchers" system parameter
//         is too long.
// *Action: Use a valid protocol name for the "mts_dispatchers" value.
00114, 00000, "missing value for system parameter mts_service"
// *Cause: There is no value for the "mts_service" system parameter, nor for
//         the "db_name" parameter.
// *Action: Add an "mts_service" or "db_name" definition to the init.ora file.
//          By default, "mts_service" is the value of "db_name" unless
//          "mts_service" is explicitly specified.
00115, 00000, "connection refused; dispatcher connection table is full"
// *Cause: A connection request was refused by a dispatcher because the
//         dispatcher cannot support any more connections.
// *Action: Connect to a different dispatcher, or use a dedicated server.
00116, 00000, "mts_service name is too long"
// *Cause: The service name specified in the "mts_service"s system parameter
//         is too long.
// *Action: Use a shorter name for the "mts_service" value (<= 255 chars).
00117, 00000, "value out of range for system parameter mts_servers"
// *Cause: The value of the "mts_servers" parameter is incorrect.
// *Action: "mts_servers" must be >= 0 and <= "mts_max_servers".
00118, 00000, "value out of range for system parameter mts_dispatchers"
// *Cause: The value of the "mts_dispatchers" parameter is incorrect.
// *Action: The sum of all "mts_dispatchers" values must be >= 0 and
//          <= "mts_max_dispatchers".
00119, 00000, "invalid specification for system parameter mts_listener_address"
// *Cause: The syntax for the "mts_listener_address" parameter is incorrect.
// *Action: refer to the manual for correct syntax.
00120, 00000, "dispatching mechanism not enabled or installed"
// *Cause: Either that the dispatching mechanism is not enabled or the
//	   ORACLE executable image is not installed with the dispatching
//         mechanism.
// *Action: refer to manual on how to enable the dispatching mechanism using
//          system parameters in the init.ora file. Failing that, consult
//          your ORACLE representative.
00121, 00000, "mts_servers specified without mts_dispatchers"
// *Cause: A definition for "mts_servers" was specified in the init.ora file,
//         but no definition for "mts_dispatchers" was specified.  Without a
//         value for "mts_dispatchers", shared servers will never be used.
// *Action: Add a definition for "mts_dispatchers" in the init.ora file
//          (or take out the definition for "mts_servers", if MTS is not

// *Cause: Too many idle servers waiting on the common queue.
// *Action: This is used internally, no action required.
00124, 00000, "mts_dispatchers specified without mts_max_servers"
// *Cause:  A definition for "mts_dispatchers" was specified in the init.ora

00200, 00000, "cannot create control file '%s'"
// *Cause:  It was not possible to create the control file
// *Action: Check obvious things like disk space, quotas, etc.
00201, 00000, "control file version %s incompatible with ORACLE version %s"
// *Cause:  The control file was created by incompatible software
// *Action: Either restart with a compatible software release or use
//          CREATE CONTROLFILE to create a new control file that is 
//          compatible with this release.
00202, 00000, "control file: '%s'"
// *Cause:  Reporting file name for details of another error
// *Action: See associated error messages
00203, 00000, "using the wrong control files"
// *Cause:  The mount id in the control file is is not the same as the
//         mount id in the control file used by the first instance to
//         mount this database. The control files are for the same database
//         but they are not the same files. Most likely one instance is using

// *Action: Check that the correct control files were specified
00204, 00000, "error in reading control file '%s' (block %s, # blocks %s)"
// *Cause:  Disk read failure of control file
// *Action: Check if disk is online, if it is not, bring it online and try
//	   warm start again.  If it is, then need to recover disk.
00205, 00000, "error in identifying control file '%s'"
// *Cause:  The system cannot find a control file of the specified name and
//	   size
// *Action: Check that ALL control files are online and the same files that
/	   the system created at cold start time.
00206, 00000, "error in writing control file '%s' (block %s, # blocks %s)"
// *Cause:  Disk write failure for control file
// *Action: Check if disk is online, if it is not, bring it online and try
//	   warm start again.  If it is, then need to recover disk.
00207, 00000, "control files are not for the same database"
// *Cause:  The database id in the control file is is not the same as the
//         database id in the control file used by the first instance to
//         mount this database. Most likely one of the mounts used the wrong
//         control file or there are two databases with the same name.
// *Action: Check that the control file is for the correct database and not
//         not an old version.
00208, 00000, "number of control file names exceeds limit of %s"
// *Cause:  The system does not support this many copies of control files
// *Action: Reduce the number of control files
00209, 00000, "block size %s exceeds limit of %s bytes"
// *Cause:  Specified block size is larger than maximum block size for this
//	   machine
// *Action: Reduce the block size
00210, 00000, "cannot open control file '%s'"
// *Cause:  Cannot open the control file
// *Action: Check to make sure the control file is there and not locked by
//	   some other program
00211, 00000, "control file '%s' does not match previous control files"
// *Cause:  The specified control file is from another database
// *Action: Find and install the correct control file
00212, 00000, "block size %s below minimum required size of %s bytes"
// *Cause:  The block size specified is too small - need space for the
//	   system overhead
// *Action: Specify larger block size
00213, 00000, "cannot reuse control file '%s'; old file size %s, %s required"
// *Cause:  In order to reuse a control file, it has to be the same size as
//	    the old one
// *Action: Either do not specify reuse or specify the same size in create
//	   database statement
00214, 00000, "control file '%s' version %s inconsistent with file '%s' version %s"
// *Cause: Versions of control files and datafiles/logfiles mismatch
// *Action: Use same version of control files and datafiles/logfiles
00215, 00000, "must be at least one control file"
// *Cause: No control file is specified or control file specified does
//         not exist
// *Action: Specify at least one valid control file
00216, 00000, "unable to determine physical block size for control file '%s'"
// *Cause: An error occurred while determining the  physical block size of this
//	  control file.
// *Action: Check the error stack for detailed information.
00217, 00000, "control file '%s' physical block size %s inconsistent with %s"
// *Cause:  The physical block size of the system is inconsistent
//	    with the block size of the control file
// *Action: The system will NOT come up with invalid control files,
//	    either restore a good copy of the control file or
/	    cold start.
00218, 00000, "control file '%s' was created with block size %s now is %s"
// *Cause: The physical block size as stored in the control file header is 
//         different than the physical block size returned by the O/S.  This
//	   usually indicates that the control file has been corrupted.
// *Action: You need to restore a good copy of the control file.
00219, 00000, "required control file size %s larger than maximum %s"
// *Cause: Create database has specified a combination of parameters that
//	   results in the control file exceeding the internal maximum
//	   size.
// *Action: Create the database, using "maxdatafiles" or "maxlogfiles"
//	    clauses in the create database statement.
00220, 00000, "control file '%s' not mounted by first instance"
// *Cause:  The specified control file has a different mount id than the
//          other control files that are being mounted. This means that
//          the first instance to mount the database did not use this
//          control file.
// *Action: Find and install the correct control file
00221, 00000, "error on write to control file"
// *Cause:  One or more of the control files could not be written.
// *Action: See accompanying errors.
00222, 00000, "control file may not be queried using dispatcher"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use client process connected to dispatcher. This is
//          not allowed for queries to control file fixed tables due to the
//          memory requirements.
// *Action: Connect directly to the instance then execute query.
00223, 00000, "conversion data file is invalid or incorrect version"
// *Cause:  A V6->V7 conversion data file contains invalid data or was
//          created with an old version of the conversion utility.
// *Action: Use a correct conversion file or regenerate it with a newer
//          conversion utility.
00224, 00000, "the specified file is not a control file"
// *Cause:  The control file specified in the init.ora file is not
//	    a control file.
// *Action: Edit the init.ora file and specify the correct control file name.
00225, 00000, "expected size %s of controlfile '%s' differs from actual size %s"
// *Cause: The expected size of the control file as stored in its header 
//         is different than the actual operating system file size of the
//	   control file - this usually indicates that the control file has 
//         been corrupted.
// *Action: You need to restore a good copy of the control file.

/ 250 .. 299 archival & media recovery errors
/
00250, 00000, "archiver not started"
// *Cause:  Automatic archiver must be running in order to stop it.
// *Action: Command not needed
00251, 00000, "unused error"
// *Cause:
// *Action:
00252, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is empty, cannot archive"
// *Cause:  A log must be used for redo generation before it can be archived.
//          Most likely the log has not been used since it was added to the
//          database. However it is possible that instance death during a
//          log switch left the log empty. The log does not need archiving.
// *Action: Do not archive the log.
00253, 00000, "limit of %s exceeded by length %s of archive string '%s' "
// *Cause: The archive string specified is too long.
// *Action: Use a shorter string.
00254, 00000, "error in archive control string '%s'"
// *Cause: The archive string does not refer to a valid destination.
// *Action: check the archive string used to make sure it refers to a valid
//	   and on-line device.
00255, 00000, "error archiving log %s of thread %s, sequence # %s"
// *Cause: An error occurred during archival.
// *Action: Check the error stack for more detailed information. If it is not
//          possible to archive the log because the online log is corrupted,
//          then the log can be cleared using the UNARCHIVED option. This will
//          make any existing backups useless for recovery to any time after
//          the log was created, but will allow the database to generate redo.
00256, 00000, "error occurred in translating archive text string '%s'"
// *Cause:  An error occurred translating the archive control string.
// *Action: Check the error stack for more detailed information.
00257, 00000, "archiver error. Connect internal only, until freed."
// *Cause:  The archiver process recieved an error while trying to archive
//	  a log.  Unless the problem is resolved soon, the database will
//	  stop executing transactions.
// *Action:  By far the most likely cause of the error is the archive
//	  destination device is out of space.  Check archiver trace file
//	  for detail description of the problem.
00258, 00000, "manual archiving in NOARCHIVELOG mode must identify log"
// *Cause: The database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode and a command to manually
//          archive a log did not specify the log explicitly by sequence
//          number, group number or file name.
// *Action: Specify log by file name, by group number or by thread and
//          sequence number.
00259, 00000, "log %s of open thread %s is the current log, cannot archive"
// *Cause:  The current log of an open thread cannot be archived because it
//          may still be in use for redo generation.
// *Action: Force a log switch in the instance that has the thread open.
//          If there are no open instances it will be necessary to open the
//          database so that crash recovery can close the thread.
00260, 00000, "cannot find online log sequence %s for thread %s"
// *Cause: The log sequence number supplied to the archival command does
//         not match any of the online logs for the thread. The log may
//         have been reused for another sequence number, it may have been
//         dropped, the sequence number may be greater than the current
//         log sequence number, or the thread may not have any logs.
// *Action: Specify a valid log sequence number.
00261, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is being archived or modified"
// *Cause:  The log is either being archived by another process or an
//          administrative command is modifying the log. Clearing, adding a
//          member, droping a member, renaming a member, and dropping the
//          log are operations which modify the log. 
// *Action: Wait for the other operation to complete.
00262, 00000, "current log %s of closed thread %s cannot switch"
// *Cause:  The log can not be cleared or manually archived because it is
//          the current log of a closed thread, and it is not possible to
//          switch logs so another log is current. All other logs for the
//          thread need to be archived, or cleared, and cannot be reused.
// *Action: Archive another log in the same thread first, or complete the
//          clearing. See attached errors for the reason the switch cannot
//          be completed.
00263, 00000, "there are no logs that need archiving for thread %s"
// *Cause:  A command to manually archive unarchived logs found no logs
//          for this thread needing archival.
// *Action: None.
00264, 00000, "no recovery required"
// *Cause:  Media recovery attempted on files which do not need any recovery.
//          The files do not even need crash recovery.
// *Action: Do media recovery on other files or not at all.
00265, 00000, "Instance recovery required, cannot set ARCHIVELOG mode"
// *Cause:  Database was shutdown with the abort option or crashed. Media
//          recovery can not be enabled because the online logs may not
//          be sufficient to recover the current datafiles.
// *Action: Open the database and then shutdown normal or immediate.
00266, 00000, "name of archived log file needed"
// *Cause:  Media recovery requested the name of an archived log file but
//          no name was entered.
// *Action: Mount the correct log file and enter its name.
00267, 00000, "name of archived log file not needed"
// *Cause:  Media recovery did not requested the name of an archived log file
//           but a name was entered.
// *Action: Continue media recovery without entering a new log name.
00268, 00000, "Specified logfile does not exist '%s'"
// *Cause:  The given logfile does not exist.
// *Action:  Check spelling and capitalization and resubmit.
00269, 00000, "Specified logfile is part of thread %s not %s"
// *Cause:  The given logfile is not part of the given thread
// *Action:  Resubmit the command after correcting error.
00270, 00000, "error creating archive log"
// *Cause:  An error was encountered either in creating or opening
//          the destination file for archiving.
// *Action: Make sure that the archive destination is valid, and that
//          sufficient space is available to write the archive.
00271, 00000, "there are no logs that need archiving"
// *Cause:  A command to manually archive unarchived logs found no logs
//          needing archival.
// *Action: None.
00272, 00000, "error writing archive log"
// *Cause:  An I/O error occurred while writing to the archive log.
// *Action: Make sure that the output device is still available, or
//          correct any device-specific errors.  Also make sure that
//          sufficient space is available on the output device.
00273, 00000, "media recovery of direct load data that was not logged"
// *Cause:  Media recovery encountered a table that was loaded by the direct
//          loader without logging redo. Some or all of the blocks in the
//          table are now marked as logically corrupt.
// *Action: The table must be dropped or truncated so that the corrupted blocks
//          may be reused. If a more recent backup of the file is available,
//          it might be recoverable without getting this error.
00274, 00000, "Illegal recovery option %s"
// *Cause:
// *Action:
00275, 00000, "media recovery has already been started"
// *Cause: Attempt to start a second media recovery in the same session.
// *Action: Complete or cancel the first media recovery session.
00276, 00000, "CHANGE keyword specified but no change number given"
// *Cause:
// *Action:
00277, 00000, "Illegal option to the UNTIL recovery flag %s"
// *Cause:  The only legal UNTIL options are "CANCEL", "CHANGE" and "TIME"
// *Action: Resubmit command with proper option
00278, 00000, "Logfile '%s' no longer needed for this recovery"
// *Cause:  The specified log file is no longer needed for the current 
//          recovery.
// *Action: None required, although the archived logfile may be removed
//          from its current location to conserve disk space.  Be aware that 
//          the logfile may still be required for some unforseen need for
//          another recovery in the future.
00279, 00000, "Change %s generated at %s needed for thread %s"
// *Cause: To proceed with recovery the requested log is required.
// *Action:  Please supply the requested log with "ALTER DATABASE RECOVER
//           LOGFILE <file_name>" or cancel recovery with "ALTER DATABASE
//           RECOVER CANCEL".
00280, 00000, "Change %s for thread %s is in sequence #%s"
// *Cause:  This is an informational message to aid in locating the specified
//          change number.
// *Action: (see error #279)
00281, 00000, "media recovery may not be preformed using dispatcher"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use client process connected to dispatcher. This is
//          not allowed for media recovery due to the memory requirements.
// *Action: Connect directly to the instance then do media recovery.
00282, 00000, "UPI %s call not supported, use ALTER DATABASE RECOVER"
// *Cause: The given UPI call is no longer supported.
// *Action: Use the ALTER DATABASE RECOVER command for all recovery actions.
00283, 00000, "Recovery session canceled due to errors"
// *Cause: An error during recovery was determined to be fatal enough to end
//         the current recovery session.
// *Action: Refer to other errors on the error stack for appropriate action.
00284, 00000, "Recovery session still in progress"
// *Cause: An error during recovery was determined to be minor enough to allow
//         the current recovery session to continue.
// *Action: Refer to other errors on the error stack for appropriate action.
00285, 00000, "TIME not given as a string constant"
// *Cause:  UNTIL TIME was not followed by a string constant for the time.
// *Action: Enter the time enclosed in single quotes
00286, 00000, "No members available, or no member contains valid data"
// *Cause:  None of the members of a logfile group are available, or
//          the available members do not contain complete data.
// *Action: If a member is temporarily offline, attempt to make it available.
//          Make sure that the correct file names are being used, especially
//          if the log is being accessed from a remote location.
00287, 00000, "Specified change number %s not found in thread %s"
// *Cause:  The given change number does not appear in any of the online
//          logs for the given thread.
// *Action: Correct statement.  Suggest simply archiving the "NEXT" log.
00288, 00000, "To continue recovery type ALTER DATABASE RECOVER CONTINUE"
// *Cause:  During media recovery, a new log is not required but it was
//          necessary to do a checkpoint and report errors.
// *Action: Type ALTER DATABASE RECOVER CONTINUE and recovery will resume
00289, 00000, "Suggestion : %s"
// *Cause:  If the kernel were to archive the file now under the current
//          log_archive_dest, then the log file name would look as suggested.
//          If the log_archive_dest parameter was the same back when the log
//          log was archived, then that it where it was archived to.
// *Action: Consider using this file name for the next log to give recovery.
00290, 00000, "Operating system archival error occurred. See error below"
// *Cause:  While attempting to archive a log file, the kernel encountered
//          an unexpected operating system error.  
// *Action: Correct the operating system error (given in the message) 
//          and retry the operation
00291, 0000, "numeric value required for PARALLEL option"
// *Cause:  A recovery command was specified incorrectly.  The PARALLEL option
//          must be followed by a numeric argument to specify the degree
//          of parallelism.
// *Action: Re-enter the command with a numeric argument following the 
//          PARALLEL keyword.
/
00292, 00000, "parallel recovery feature not installed"
// *Cause:  A parallel recovery was requested when the parallel
//          recovery option is not installed.
// *Action: Delete the PARALLEL clause from the RECOVER command. Also,
//          delete the RECOVERY_PARALLELISM parameter in initialization
//          file (the init.ora file).
00293, 00000, "control file out of sync with redolog"
// *Cause:  The redolog and control file are out of sync because a
//          non-current controle file was specified when the instance
//          was started.
// *Action: Retry the Recover command using the current control file
//          or retry the Recover command using the USING BACKUP
//          CONTROL FILE clause.
//          
/ 300..369 - Redo File errors
/
00300, 00000, "illegal redo log block size %s specified - exceeds limit of %s"
// *Cause:  The specified block size of the redo log is greater than the
//	    maximum block size for the system.
// *Action: Create the redo log on a device with a smaller block size
00301, 00000, "error in adding log file '%s' - file cannot be created"
// *Cause:  The creation of the log file failed
// *Action: Check: 1) there is enough space on the device
//		   2) the name of the file is valid
//		   3) the device is online
//		   4) an IO error occurred
//	    consult associated errors for further information.

// *Cause:  none
// *Action: none
00304, 00000, "requested instance_number is busy"
// *Cause:  The instance specified by the instance_number parameter is busy.
// *Action: Either specify another instance_number,
//	    or shut down the running instance with this number
//	    or wait for instance recovery to complete on the instance with
//	       this number.
00305, 00000, "log %s of thread %s inconsistent; belongs to another database"
// *Cause:  The database id in the log file does not match the database id
//          in the control file.
// *Action: Restore the correct log file
00306, 00000, "limit of %s instances in this database"
// *Cause:  Starting this instance would exceed the maximum number
//	    of instances allowed for this database.  Occurs only
//	    with STARTUP shared and multiple instances.
// *Action: You cannot start more than the lower of
//	    a) port-specific limit to number of instances
//	    b) the number of instances specified at create-database time
00307, 00000, "requested instance_number out of range, maximum is %s"
// *Cause:  The instance_number paramater specified an instance number
//	    that was out of range
// *Action: Change the parameter.  The mimimum instance_number is one,
//	    and the maximum instance_number is the lower of the port-specific
//	    maximum or the user-specified maximum when the database
//	    was created.
00308, 00000, "cannot open archived log '%s'"
// *Cause:  The system cannot open the specified archived redo log.
// *Action: Restore access the log (check name, device, etc.) and retry.
00309, 00000, "log belongs to wrong database"
// *Cause:  The system cannot apply the redo log because it
//	    belongs to another database
// *Action: Restore the correct redo log

// *Cause:  Reporting file name for details of another error
// *Action: See associated error messages
00313, 00000, "open failed for members of log group %s of thread %s"
// *Cause:  The online log cannot be opened. May not be able to find file.
// *Action: See accompanying errors and make log available.
00314, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, expected sequence# %s doesn't match %s"
// *Cause:  The online log is corrupted or is an old version.
// *Action: Find and install correct version of log or reset logs.

// *Cause:  The online log is corrupted or is an old version.
// *Action: Find and install correct version of log or reset logs.
00316, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, type %s in header is not log file"
// *Cause:  The online log is corrupted or is an old version.
// *Action: Find and install correct version of log or reset logs.
00317, 00000, "file type %s in header is not log file"
// *Cause:  This is not an archived log file.
// *Action: Find the correct file and try again.
00318, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, expected file size %s doesn't match %s"
// *Cause:  On header read the file size indicated in the control
//	    file did not match the file size contained in the log file.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00319, 00000, "log %s of thread %s has incorrect log reset status"
// *Cause:  Check of log file header at database open found that an online
//          log has log reset data that is different from the control file.
//          The log is probably an incorrectly restored backup.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00320, 00000, "cannot read file header from log %s of thread %s"
// *Cause:  The file is not available.
// *Action: Restore the log file.
00321, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, cannot update log file header"
// *Cause:  Cannot write to the log file.
// *Action: Restore the access to the file.
00322, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is not current copy"
// *Cause:  Check of log file header at database open found that an online
//          log appears to be an incorrectly restored backup.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00323, 00000, "Current log of thread %s not useable and all others need archiving"
// *Cause:  Attempt to open thread failed because it is necessary to switch
//          redo generation to another online log, but all the other logs
//          need to be archived before they can be used.
// *Action: Archive the logs for the thread then retry open.
00324, 00000, "logfile '%s' translated name '%s' too long, %s characters exceeds %s limit"
// *Cause:  the translated name for a log file is too long.
// *Action: Choose a untranslated name that yields a shorter translated name.
00325, 00000, "archived log for thread %s, wrong thread # %s in header"
// *Cause:  The archived log is corrupted or for another thread. Can not
//          use the log for applying redo.
// *Action: Find correct archived log.
00326, 00000, "log begins at change %s, need earlier change %s"
// *Cause:  The archived log supplied for recovery was generated after the
//          log that is needed. Can not yet use the log for applying redo.
// *Action: Find correct archived log.
00327, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, physical size %s less than needed %s"
// *Cause:  A log file has shrunk in size. This is likely
//	    to have been caused by operator or operating system error.
// *Action: Restore the log file from backup.  If backup is not available,
//	    drop this log and recreate.  If the database was shut down
//	    cleanly, no further action should be required; otherwise
//	    incomplete recovery may be required.
00328, 00000, "archived log ends at change %s, need later change %s"
// *Cause:  The archived log supplied for recovery was generated before the
//          log that is needed. Can not use the log for applying redo.
// *Action: Find correct archived log.
00329, 00000, "archived log begins at change %s, need change %s"
// *Cause:  The archived log is not the correct log. An earlier log is needed.
// *Action: Restore the correct log file.
00330, 00000, "archived log ends at change %s, need change %s"
// *Cause:  The archived log is not the correct log. A later log is needed.
// *Action: Restore the correct log file.
00331, 00000, "log version %s incompatible with ORACLE version %s"
// *Cause:  The log was written by incompatible version of Oracle.
// *Action: Recover the database with the compatible software, shut it
//	    down cleanly, then restart with current software.
00332, 00000, "archived log is too small - may be incompletely archived"
// *Cause:  The log is smaller than the space allocated in it. May be the
//          result of a shutdown abort while it was being written by the
//          archiver.
// *Action: Get a complete version of this log and use it for recovery. There
//          should either be an online version of it or a copy that was
//          successfully archived.
00333, 00000, "redo log read error block %s count %s"
// *Cause:  An IO error occurred while reading the log described in the
//          accompanying error.
// *Action: Restore accessibility to file, or get another copy of the file.
00334, 00000, "archived log: '%s'"
// *Cause:  Reporting file name for details of another error
// *Action: See associated error messages
00335, 00000, "online log %s: No log with this number, log does not exist"
// *Cause:  Reporting file name for details of another error
// *Action: See associated error messages
00336, 00000, "log file size %s blocks is less than minimum %s blocks"
// *Cause:  The log file size as specified in create database is too small.
// *Action: Increase the log file size.
00337, 00000, "log file '%s' does not exist and no size specified"
// *Cause:  An attempt to add a log found neither an existing file
//	    nor a size for creating the file.
// *Action: Specify a size for the log file.
00338, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is more recent than control file"
// *Cause:  The control file change sequence number in the log file is 
//         greater than the number in the control file. This implies that
//         the wrong control file is being used. Note that repeatedly causing
//         this error can make it stop happening without correcting the real
//         problem. Every attempt to open the database will advance the
//         control file change sequence number until it is great enough.
// *Action: Use the current control file or do backup controlfile recovery to 
//         make the control file current. Be sure to follow all restrictions
//         on doing a backup controlfile recovery.
00339, 00000, "archived log does not contain any redo"
// *Cause:  The archived log is not the correct log. It is a copy of a logfile
//          that has never been used for redo generation, or was an online
//          log being prepared to be the current log.
// *Action: Restore the correct log file.
00340, 00000, "IO error processing online log %s of thread %s"
// *Cause:  An IO error occurred on the named online log.
// *Action: Restore accessibility to file, or restore file from backup.
00341, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, wrong log # %s in header"
// *Cause:  The internal information in an on-line log file does not
//	    match the control file.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00342, 00000, "archived log was created before last RESETLOGS"
// *Cause:  Recovery was given a log that was created before the last
//          ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS command. There should be another
//          log created since then that contains the correct redo.
// *Action: Supply the correct log file.
00343, 00000, "too many errors, log member closed"
// *Cause:  The maximum number of errors on this log member has been exceeded.
// *Action: Correct the underlying problem by referring to the other error
//          messages found with this one.
00344, 00000, "unable to recreate online log '%s'"
// *Cause:  An I/O failure occurred when attempting to recreate an online as
//          part of either ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS or ALTER DATABASE
//          CLEAR LOGFILE command.
// *Action: Correct the file/device as indicated by accompanying errors.
00345, 00000, "redo log write error block %s count %s"
// *Cause:  An IO error has occurred while writing the log
// *Action: Correct the cause of the error, and then restart the system.
//	    If the log is lost, apply media/incomplete recovery.
00346, 00000, "log member marked as STALE"
// *Cause:  A log file member no longer is complete.
// *Action: Correct the underlying problem by referring to the other error
//          messages found with this one.
00347, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, expected block size %s doesn't match %s"
// *Cause:  On header read the blocksize indicated in the control
//	    file did not match the blocksize contained in the log file.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00348, 00000, "single-process redo failure. Must abort instance"
// *Cause:  A failure occurred during a critical portion of the log code
//	    during single process operation.  This error does not occur
//	    during normal multi-process operation.
// *Action: Shutdown abort and warmstart the database.
00349, 00000, "failure obtaining block size for '%s'"
// *Cause:  The operating system was unable to determine the blocksize
//	    for the given file name.
// *Action: Consult the accompanying error message, and correct the
//	    device or specify another file name.
00350, 00000, "log %s of thread %s needs to be archived"
// *Cause:  The command cannot be done because the log has not been archived,
//          and media recovery has been enabled.
// *Action: Archive the log or disable media recovery. If the command supports
//          an UNARCHIVED option then it can be used. However this may result
//          in making backups unuseable, and forcing the drop of some offline
//          files.
00351, 00000, "recover-to time invalid"
// *Cause:  The time specified in a recover-until statement must
//	    be after January 1st 1988.
// *Action: Specify a time after January 1st 1988.
00352, 00000, "all logs for thread %s need to be archived - cannot enable"
// *Cause:  Attempting to enable a thread with all logs needing to be 
//          archived, and media recovery has been enabled. There is no log
//          that can be made the new current log for the thread.
// *Action: Archive a log for the thread or disable media recovery.
00353, 00000, "log corruption near block %s change %s time %s"
// *Cause:  Some type of redo log corruption has been discovered. This error
//          describes the location of the corruption. Accompanying errors
//          describe the type of corruption.
// *Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do incomplete
//          recovery up to the indicated change or time.
00354, 00000, "corrupt redo log block header"
// *Cause:  The block header on the redo block indicated by the accompanying
//          error, is not reasonable.
// *Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do time based
//          recovery up to the indicated time. If this happens when archiving,
//          archiving of the problem log can be skipped by clearing the log
//          with the UNARCHIVED option. This must be followed by a backup of
//          every datafile to insure recoverability of the database.
00355, 00000, "change numbers out of order"
// *Cause:  A change number found in the redo log is lower than a previously
//          encountered change number. The log is corrupted in some way. The
//          corruption may be at the earlier change or at this one.
// *Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do time based
//          recovery up to the indicated time.
00356, 00000, "inconsistent lengths in change description"
// *Cause:  A change record in the redo log contains lengths that do not add
//          up to a consistent value. The log is corrupted in some way.
// *Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do time based
//          recovery up to the indicated time.
00357, 00000, "too many members specified for log file, the maximum is %s"
// *Cause:  A add logfile or add logfile member command would result in a
//          log with too many members.  The number of members is set when the
//          database is created.
// *Action: Use fewer log file members.
00358, 00000, "Too many file members specified, the maximum is %s"
// *Cause:  A create or alter statement specified too many members in a
//          parenthesised file list.
// *Action: Specify a number of file members that is within the port-defined
//          limit.
00359, 00000, "Logfile group %s does not exist"
// *Cause:  An add logfile member or drop logfile request specified a logfile
//          group number that does not exist.
// *Action: Check the configuration of the logfiles and reissue the command.
00360, 00000, "not a logfile member: %s"
// *Cause:  A file name was given to drop logfile member that is not a
//          part of the database, or which is a data file.
// *Action: Supply a valid logfile member name.
00361, 00000, "cannot remove last log member %s for group %s"
// *Cause:  An attempt has been made to remove the last member of a log file
//          group.
// *Action: If desired, delete the entire log, by using DROP LOGFILE.
00362, 00000, "member is required to form a valid logfile in group %s"
// *Cause:  A request to drop a logfile member was denied because it would
//          remove data required to form a complete logfile.
// *Action: If desired, delete the entire log (after archiving if required),
//          by using DROP LOGFILE;
00363, 00000, "log is not the archived version"
// *Cause:  The log given to recovery is a backup of the online version from
//          the time it was the current log. The archived version of the log
//          would not be marked as end of thread. This error can also be
//          caused by failing to list the current log of an enabled thread
//          in a CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
// *Action: Find the archived version of the log and supply its name. If this
//          is media recovery immediately following a CREATE CONTROLFILE, be
//          sure the current log for this thread was included.
00364, 00000, "can not write header to new log member"
// *Cause:  An i/o error occurred when attempting to write the header to a
//          log member that is being added to an existing group.
// *Action: See accompaning errors. Fix problem or use another file.
00365, 00000, "the specified log is not the correct next log"
// *Cause:  The specified log failed to pass checks to ensure it corresponds
//          to the log that was just applied.  This is probably the result
//          of using a log that was generated against a cold backup image
//          of the database.
// *Action: Find the log that was generated by this copy of the database
//          and give that filename to recovery.
00366, 00000, "log %s of thread %s, checksum error in the file header"
// *Cause:  The file header for the redo log contains a checksum that does
//          not match the value calculated from the file header as read from
//          disk. This means the file header is corrupted
// *Action: Find and install correct version of log or reset logs.
00367, 00000, "checksum error in log file header"
// *Cause:  The file header for the redo log contains a checksum that does
//          not match the value calculated from the file header as read from
//          disk. This means the file header is corrupted
// *Action: Find the correct file and try again.
00368, 00000, "checksum error in redo log block"
// *Cause:  The redo block indicated by the accompanying error, is not
//          vaild. It has a checksum that does not match the block contents.
// *Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do time based
//          recovery up to the indicated time. If this happens when archiving,
//          archiving of the problem log can be skipped by clearing the log
//          with the UNARCHIVED option. This must be followed by a backup of
//          every datafile to insure recoverability of the database.
// *Action: Restore correct file or reset logs.
00369, 00000, "Current log of thread %s not useable and other log being cleared"
// *Cause:  Attempt to open thread failed because it is necessary to switch
//          redo generation to another online log, but all the other logs are
//          being cleared or need to be archived before they can be used.
// *Action: If the ALTER DATABASE CLEAR LOGFILE command is still active then
//          wait for it to complete. Otherwise reissue the CLEAR command. If
//          there are other online logs for the thread, that are not being
//          cleared, then archive the logs.

/ 370-389 kcb external errors
/
00370, 00000, "potential deadlock during kcbchange operation"
// *Cause:  Error code used internally by software. Should never be reported
// *Action: Treat as internal error. See error 600.
00371, 00000, "no free buffer handles available"
// *Cause:  Init.ora parameter db_handles is too small
// *Action: Increase the parameter value - default should be sufficient
00372, 00000, "file %s cannot be modified at this time"
// *Cause:  attempting to modify the contents of a file that cannot be
//          modified. The file is most likely part of a read only tablespace
//          but may be in the process of going offline, or the database may
//          be in the process of closing.
// *Action: check the status of the file and its tablespace
00373, 00000, "online log version %s incompatible with ORACLE version %s"
// *Cause:  The online log was written by incompatible version of Oracle.
//	    Can occur when the log file was created by either a new or
//	    older version of Oracle.
// *Action: Recover the database with the compatible software, shut it
//	    down cleanly, then restart with current software.
00374, 00000, "parameter db_block_size = %s invalid, valid range [%s..%s]"
// *Cause:  invalid value for db_block_size parameter
// *Action: adjust parameter and restart
00375, 00000, "unable to get default db_block_size"
// *Cause:  the system was unable to determine the default db_block_size
// *Action: see accompanying system specific error.  As a workaround,
//	    specify the blocksize in the init.ora file.
00376, 00000, "file %s cannot be read at this time"
// *Cause:  attempting to read from a file that is not readable. Most likely
//          the file is offline.
// *Action: Check the state of the file. Bring it online
/
/ 390-399: more Redo log errors
/
00390, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is being cleared, cannot become current log"
// *Cause:  An attempt to switch to a new online log for the redo thread
//          failed because no reusable log could be found. This log is being
//          cleared and will be useable when the clearing completes. The
//          command that began the clearing may have terminated without
//          completing the clearing.
// *Action: If the clear command is still executing then wait for its
//          completion. If it terminated then reissue the clear command, or
//          drop the log.
00391, 00000, "All threads must switch to new log format at the same time"
// *Cause:  An attempt to switch the current log of a single thread is not
//          allowed because the compatiblity requirements force a new log
//          format version number. When changing log formats, all threads
//          must switch to the new format at the same time.
// *Action: Open the database to cause the coordinated log switch. If that
//          is not possible then return to the same software version and
//          compatibility setting last used to open the database.
00392, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is being cleared, operation not allowed"
// *Cause:  An operation encountered this online log in the middle of being
//          cleared.  The command that began the clearing may have terminated
//          without completing the clearing.
// *Action: If the clear command is still executing then wait for its
//          completion. If it terminated then reissue the clear command, or
//          drop the log.
00393, 00000, "log %s of thread %s is needed for recovery of offline datafiles"
// *Cause:  Log cannot be cleared because the redo in it is needed to recover
//          offline datafiles. It has not been archived so there is no
//          other copy available. If the log is cleared the tablespaces
//          containing the files will have to be dropped.
// *Action: Archive the log then repeat the clear command. If archiving is not
//          possible, and dropping the tablespaces is acceptible, then add the
//          clause UNRECOVERABLE DATAFILE at the end of the clear command.

// *Cause:  The value specified cannot be supported by this release of
//          the software.
// *Action: Choose an appropriate value, or remove the parameter value to
//          use the default value.
00402, 00000, "database changes by release %s cannot be used by release %s"
// *Cause:  Changes have been made to the database that require a newer
//          software release or that violate the compatibility parameters.
// *Action: Use a version of the software that can understand the changes or
//          relax the compatibility requirements in the init file.
00403, 00000, "%s (%s) is not the same as other instances (%s)"
// *Cause:  Another instance has set the compatible or compatible no
//          recovery parameters differently than this instance.
// *Action: Change the parameters of the current instance to match other
//          instances already running.
00404, 00000, "Conversion data file not found: '%s'"
// *Cause:  The file used for converting the database from V6 to V7 could
//          not be found.
// *Action: Verify that the conversion process has been started on this
//          database and that the data file name is accessable.
00405, 00000, "compatibility type \"%s\""
// *Cause:  Reporting a type associated with another error.
// *Action: See accompaning error
00406, 00000, "COMPATIBLE parameter needs to be %s or greater"
// *Cause:  The COMPATIBLE initialization parameter is not high
//          enough to allow the operation. Allowing the command would make
//          the database incompatible with the release specified by the

// *Cause: An attempt to shutdown normally found that an online backup is
//        still in progress.
// *Action: End the backup of the offending tablespace and retry this command.
01150, 00000, "cannot prevent writes - file %s has online backup set"
// *Cause: An attempt to make a tablespace read only or offline normal found
//          that an online backup is still in progress. It will be necessary
//          to write the file header to end the backup, but that would not
//          be allowed if this command succeeded.
// *Action: End the backup of the offending tablespace and retry this command.
01151, 00000, "use media recovery to recover block, restore backup if needed"
// *Cause:  Error 1172 occurred.
// *Action: This is additional information for error 1172.
01152, 00000, "file %s was not restored from a sufficiently old backup "
// *Cause:  An incomplete recovery session was started, but an insufficient
//	   number of logs were applied to make the database consistent. This
//         file is still in the future of the last log applied. The most
//         likely cause of this error is forgetting to restore the file
//         from a backup before doing incomplete recovery.
// *Action: Either apply more logs until the database is consistent or
//	   restore the database file from an older backup and repeat recovery.
01153, 00000, "an incompatible media recovery is active"
// *Cause: Attempt to start an incompatible media recovery or open resetlogs
//         during media recovery. Media recovery sessions are incompatible if 
//         they attempt to recover the same data file. Incomplete media
//         recovery or open resetlogs is incompatible with any media recovery.
// *Action: Complete or cancel the other media recovery session.
01154, 00000, "database busy. Open, close, mount, and dismount not allowed now"
// *Cause: Some operation is in progress that expects the opened/mounted state
//	   of this instance to remain the same.
// *Action: Wait for the operation to complete then retry. If attempting to
//	   do a shutdown, SHUTDOWN ABORT will work.
01155, 00000, "the database is being opened, closed, mounted or dismounted"
// *Cause: The requested operation needs the instance to be in a particular
//	   state but the state is being changed.
// *Action: Wait for the open, close, mount, or dismount to complete then
//	   retry the operation. If necessary, a SHUTDOWN ABORT will always
//	   work.
01156, 00000, "recovery in progress may need access to files"
// *Cause: Either media recovery or instance recovery is in progress. It may
//	   need the files this operation is being applied to.
// *Action: Wait for recovery to complete.
01157, 00000, "cannot identify data file %s - file not found"
// *Cause:  The background process was not able to find one of the data files.
//         The database will prohibit access to this file but other files will
//         be unaffected. However the first instance to open the database will
//         need to access all online data files. Accompanying error from the
//         operating system describes why file was not found.
// *Action: Have operating system make file available to database. Then either
//         open the database or do ALTER SYSTEM CHECK DATAFILES.
01158, 00000, "database %s already mounted"
// *Cause:  Another instance has a database by this name mounted.
// *Action: Find which instance is still running.  Perhaps you have not lost
//	    the control files after all.
01159, 00000, "file is not from same database as previous files - wrong database id"
// *Cause: Not all of the files specified in CREATE CONTROLFILE are from the
//	  same database. The database id of this file does not match that
//        from the first file specified.
// *Action: Please double check the list of files provided to the CREATE
01160, 00000, "file is not a %s"
// *Cause: The named file in the DATAFILE or LOGFILE section of the CREATE
//	  CONTROLFILE command does not appear to be as stated.
// *Action:  Please double check the mentioned file.
01161, 00000, "database name %s in file header does not match given name of %s"
// *Cause: The database name given at the command line does not match the
//	  database name found in the file header.
// *Action: Chance are good that the database name specified at the command
//	  line is incorrect.  Resolve the descepency, and resubmit the command.
//        If you are attempting to change the database name, be sure to 
//        use the SET DATABASE option.
01162, 00000, "block size %s in file header does not match DB_BLOCK_SIZE (%s)"
// *Cause: CREATE CONTROLFILE discovered that the block size for this file
//         is incompatible with the init.ora parameter DB_BLOCK_SIZE used to
//         allocate cache buffers. If not the first file then there are a
//         mixture of block sizes, or the file is corrupt.
// *Action:If this is the first file in the command then correct DB_BLOCK_SIZE
//         to match the file and restart the instance. If not the first file
//         find the correct version of the file.
01163, 00000, "SIZE clause indicates %s (blocks), but should match header %s"
// *Cause: The size specified in bytes in the SIZE clause of the CREATE 
//         CONTROLFILE statement does not equate to the number of blocks 
//         recorded in the header.
// *Action: Specify the correct filename and size ( in bytes ).
01164, 00000, "MAXLOGFILES may not exceed %s"
// *Cause:  MAXLOGFILES specified on the command line too large.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with a smaller MAXLOGFILES
01165, 00000, "MAXDATAFILES may not exceed %s"
// *Cause:  MAXDATAFILES specified on the command line too large.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with a smaller MAXDATAFILES
01166, 00000, "file number %s is larger than %s (%s)"
// *Cause: File mention in CREATE CONTROLFILE has a file number which is
//         larger than that specified for MAXDATAFILES or MAXLOGFILES.
// *Action: Increase the maximum specified on the command line.
01167, 00000, "two files are the same file/group number or the same file"
// *Cause: There is an overlap of file numbers in the files specified on
//	  the command line or the same file is specified twice. If they are
//        not the exact same file then one is likely to be a backup of the
//        other. If they are two members of the same log they must be specified
//        together in a group file spec.
// *Action: Confirm that the file mentioned is not a repeat of a file already
//	 mentioned in the command. If they are different files then omit the
//       earlier backup. If they are members of the same log, insure they are
//       in the same group file specification.
01168, 00000, "physical block size %s does not match size %s of other members"
// *Cause:  The file is located on a device with a different physical block
//          size than the other members in the group
// *Action: Use a physical device with matching block size.
01169, 00000, "DATAFILE number 1 not found.  Must be present"
// *Cause: Datafile number 1 was not specified in a CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
// *Action: Locate datafile number 1 and resubmit the CREATE CONTROLFILE
//	 command.
01170, 00000, "file not found '%s'"
// *Cause: ALL datafiles and, if NORESETLOGS, ALL logfiles MUST be
//	   accessible by the process for CREATE CONTROLFILE.
// *Action: The file specified probably contains a typing error.  Double
//	   check command and the existance of all files and then resubmit.
01171, 00000, "datafile %s going offline due to error advancing checkpoint"
// *Cause:  The checkpoint in the file header could not be advanced. See
//         accompanying errors for the reason. The datafile will be taken
//         offline the same as for a write error of a data block.
// *Action: See accompanying errors for details. Restore access to the file,
//         do media recovery, and bring it back online.
01172, 00000, "recovery of thread %s stuck at block %s of file %s"
// *Cause: Crash recovery or instance recovery could not apply a change to a
//         block because it was not the next change. This can happen if the 
//         block was corrupted and then repaired during recovery.
// *Action: Do a RECOVER DATAFILE for the file containing the block. If this
//         does not resolve the problem then restore the file from a backup
//         and  recover it.
01173, 00000, "data dictionary indicates missing data file from system tablespace"
// *Cause:  Either the database has been recovered to a point in time in the
//    future of the controlfile or a datafile from the system tablespace was
//    omitted from the create controlfile command previously issued.
// *Action: For the former problem you need to recover the database from a
//    more recent controlfile.	For the latter problem, simply recreate the
//    controlfile checking to be sure that you include all the datafiles in
//    the system tablespace.
01174, 00000, "DB_FILES is %s buts needs to be %s to be compatible"
// *Cause:  The maximum number of database files supported by this instance 
//         is not the same as for the other instances. All instances must
//         be able to open all the files any instance can open.
// *Action: Change the value of the DB_FILES parameter to be compatible
01175, 00000, "data dictionary has more than the %s files allowed by the instance"
// *Cause:  The data dictionary is found to have more files than that which can
//     be supported by this instance.
// *Action: Shutdown the instance and restart with a larger number of db_files
01176, 00000, "data dictionary has more than the %s files allowed by the controlfie"
// *Cause: After a CREATE CONTROLFILE, the data dictionary was found to have
//    more datafiles than that supported by the controlfile.
// *Action: Recreate the controlfile with a larger MAXDATAFILES.
01177, 00000, "data file does not match dictionary - probably old incarnation"
// *Cause:  When comparing the control file with the data dictionary after
//          a CREATE CONTROLFILE or OPEN RESETLOGS, it was noted that this
//          datafile was inconsistent with the dictionary. Most likely the
//          file is a backup of a file that was dropped from the database,
//          and the same file number was reused for a new file. It may also
//          be that an incomplete recovery stopped at a time when this file
//          number was used for another datafile.
// *Action: Do a CREATE CONTROLFILE with the correct file or none at all.
01178, 00000, "file %s created before last CREATE CONTROLFILE, cannot recreate"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use ALTER DATABASE CREATE DATAFILE to recreate a
//          datafile that existed at the last CREATE CONTROL file command.
//          The information needed to recreate the file was lost with the
//          control file that existed when the file was added to the database.
// *Action: Find a backup of the file, and recover it. Do incomplete recovery
//          to time before file was originally created.
01179, 00000, "file %s does not exist"
// *Cause:  During datafile recovery, a file was listed which was not part
//    for the database.
// *Action:  Recheck the datafile name.  Remember to use double quotes at the
//    SQLDBA command line and remember that the file name is translated in the
//    environment of the SQLDBA.
01180, 00000, "can not create datafile 1"
// *Cause:  Attempting to create datafile 1 using ALTER DATABASE CREATE
//          DATAFILE.
// *Action: Recover file from a backup or recreate database.
01181, 00000, "file %s created before last RESETLOGS, cannot recreate"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use ALTER DATABASE CREATE DATAFILE to recreate a
//          datafile that existed at the last RESETLOGS database open.
// *Action: Find a backup of the file, and recover it. Do incomplete recovery
//          to time before file was originally created.
01182, 00000, "cannot create database file %s - file is in use or recovery"
// *Cause:  Attempted to use ALTER DATABASE CREATE DATAFILE to recreate a
//          datafile that is online in an open instance or is being recovered.
// *Action: Close database in all instances and end all recovery sessions
01183, 00000, "cannot mount database in SHARED mode"
// *Cause:  Some other instance has the database mounted exclusive.
// *Action: Shutdown other instance then mount shared.
01184, 00000, "logfile group %s already exists"
// *Cause:  An ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE command specified a log number for
//          the new log which is already in use.
// *Action: Specify a different logfile number, or let the database choose
//          an unused value.
01185, 00000, "logfile group number %s is invalid"
// *Cause:  An ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE command specified a log number for
//          the new log which is too large.
// *Action: Specify a correct logfile number.
01186, 00000, "file %s failed verification tests"
// *Cause:  The data file did not pass the checks to insure it is part of the
//         database. See the accompanying error messages for the reason the
//         verification did not succeed.
// *Action: Have operating system make the correct file available to database.
//         Then either open the database or do ALTER DATABASE CHECK.
01187, 00000, "cannot read from file %s because it failed verification tests"
// *Cause:  The data file did not pass the checks to insure it is part of the
//         database. Reads are not allowed until it is verified.
// *Action: Have operating system make the correct file available to database.
//         Then either open the database or do ALTER DATABASE CHECK.
01188, 00000, "Block size %s in header does not match physical block size %s"
// *Cause:  A log file member given to CREATE CONTROLFILE is on a physical
//          device that has a different block size than the device originally
//          used to create the log.
// *Action: Move the file to a device with the correct block size or use the
//          RESETLOGS option to CREATE CONTROLFILE.
01189, 00000, "file is from a different RESETLOGS than previous files"
// *Cause:  In a CREATE CONTROLFILE command either this file or all previous
//          files were backups from before the last RESETLOGS. This may also
//          occur if this is a file that is offline and has been offline since
//          before the last RESETLOGS.
// *Action: If the file was taken offline normal before the last RESETLOGS,
//          and is still offline, omit it from the CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
//          Rename and online the file after the database is open. Otherwise
//          find the version of the mentioned file consistent with the rest
//          of the datafiles and resubmit the command.
01190, 00000, "control file or data file %s is from before the last RESETLOGS"
// *Cause: Attempting to use a data file when the log reset information in
//          the file does not match the control file. Either the data file
//          or the control file is a backup that was made before the most
//          recent ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS.
// *Action: Restore file from a more recent backup.
01191, 00000, "file %s is already offline - cannot do a normal offline"
// *Cause:  When attempting to do a normal tablespace offline it was discovered
//          that one of the files in the tablespace was already offline.
// *Action: Either bring the datafile online first, or use another tablespace
//          offline option.
01192, 00000, "must have at least one enabled thread"
// *Cause:  You must specify at least two logfiles from at least one thread
//        at the create contolfile command line.
// *Action:  Find the missing logfiles and resubmit the command with the newly
//        found logfiles included in the command line.
01193, 00000, "file %s is not the same file seen at start of recovery"
// *Cause: A different copy of the file was accessed the last time media
//         recovery looked at the file header. A backup of the file was
//         restored or the meaning of the file name changed during recovery.
// *Action:Ensure the correct file is available, then retry recovery.
01194, 00000, "file %s needs more recovery to be consistent"
// *Cause:  An incomplete recovery session was started, but an insufficient
//	   number of logs were applied to make the file consistent. The
//         reported file was not closed cleanly when it was last opened by
//         the database. It must be recovered to a time when it was not being
//         updated. The most likely cause of this error is forgetting to
//         restore the file from a backup before doing incomplete recovery.
// *Action: Either apply more logs until the file is consistent or restore
//	    the file from an older backup and repeat recovery.
01195, 00000, "online backup of file %s needs more recovery to be consistent"
// *Cause:  An incomplete recovery session was started, but an insufficient
//	   number of logs were applied to make the file consistent. The
//         reported file is an online backup which must be recovered to the
//         time the backup ended.
// *Action: Either apply more logs until the file is consistent or
//	   restore the database files from an older backup and repeat recovery.
01196, 00000, "file %s is inconsistent due to a failed media recovery session"
// *Cause:  The file was being recovered but the recovery did not terminate
//          normally. This left the file in an inconsistent state. No more
//          recovery was successfully completed on this file.
// *Action:Either apply more logs until the file is consistent or restore
//	    the backup again and repeat recovery.
01197, 00000, "thread %s only contains one log"
// *Cause:  During create controlfile all threads represented in the logs
//   must be represented by at least two logs.  A "last log" and a second
//   log.  The named thread does not contain two such logs.
// *Action:  Either find more logs from the named thread.  Or use the
//        RESETLOGS option to CREATE CONTROLFILE.
01198, 00000, "must specify size for log file if RESETLOGS"
// *Cause:  File sizes must be given for all logfiles if doing a CREATE
//          CONTROLFILE with the RESETLOGS option.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with the appropriate logfile size.
01199, 00000, "file %s is not in online backup mode"
// *Cause: Attempting to end an online backup for a file that is not in online
//         backup.
// *Action: Do not enter command since it is not needed.
01200, 00000, "actual file size of %s is smaller than correct size of %s blocks"
// *Cause:  The size of the file as returned by the operating system is smaller
//         than the size of the file as indicated in the file header and the
//         control file. Somehow the file has been truncated. Maybe it is the
//         result of a half completed copy.
// *Action: Restore a good copy of the data file and do recovery as needed.
01201, 00000, "file size %s in header does not match size %s in control file"
// *Cause:  The file sizes in the control file and in the file header do not
//         match. One of them is probably a corrupted value.
// *Action: Replace the corrupted file with a good one and do recovery as 
//         needed.
01202, 00000, "wrong incarnation of this file - wrong creation time"
// *Cause:  The creation time in the file header is not the same as the
//         creation time in the control file. This is probably a copy of a
//         file that was dropped.
// *Action: Restore a current copy of the data file and do recovery as needed.
01203, 00000, "wrong incarnation of this file - wrong creation SCN"
// *Cause:  The creation SCN in the file header is not the same as the
//         creation SCN in the control file. This is probably a copy of a
//         file that was dropped.
// *Action: Restore a current copy of the data file and do recovery as needed.
01204, 00000, "file number is %s rather than %s - wrong file"
// *Cause:  The file number in the file header is not correct. This is probably
//         a restored backup of the wrong file, but from the same database.
// *Action: Restore a copy of the correct data file and do recovery as needed.
01205, 00000, "not a data file - type number in header is %s"
// *Cause:  The file type in the header is not correct for a data file. This
//         is probably a log file or control file. If the type is not a small 
//         non-zero positive number then the header is corrupted.
// *Action: Restore a copy of the correct data file and do recovery as needed.
01206, 00000, "file is not part of this database - wrong database id"
// *Cause:  The database id in the file header does not match the database id
//         in the control file. The file may be from a different database, or
//         it may not be a database file at all. If the database was rebuilt,
//         this may be a file from before the rebuild.
// *Action: Restore a copy of the correct data file and do recovery as needed.
01207, 00000, "file is more recent than control file - old control file"
// *Cause:  The control file change sequence number in the data file is 
//         greater than the number in the control file. This implies that
//         the wrong control file is being used. Note that repeatedly causing
//         this error can make it stop happening without correcting the real
//         problem. Every attempt to open the database will advance the
//         control file change sequence number until it is great enough.
// *Action: Use the current control file or do backup controlfile recovery to 
//         make the control file current. Be sure to follow all restrictions 
//         on doing a backup controlfile recovery.
01208, 00000, "data file is an old version - not accessing current version"
// *Cause:  The checkpoint in the file header is less recent than in the
//         control file. If opening a database that is already open by another
//         instance, or if another instance just onlined this file, then
//         we are probably looking at a different version of the file.
//         Otherwise a backup of the file was probably restored while the
//         file was in use.
// *Action: Have operating system make correct file available to database.
//         Then either open the database or do ALTER DATABASE CHECK.
01209, 00000, "data file is from before the last RESETLOGS"
// *Cause:  The reset log data in the file header does not match the
//         control file. If the database is closed or the file is offline
//         this is an old backup that was taken before the last ALTER
//         DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS command. If opening a database that is
//         already open by another instance, or if another instance just
//         onlined this file, then we are probably looking at a different
//         version of the file. Otherwise a backup of the file was probably
//         restored while the file was in use.
// *Action: Have operating system make correct file available to database.
//         Then either open the database or do ALTER DATABASE CHECK.
01210, 00000, "data file header is media corrupt"
// *Cause: The file header block is internally inconsistent. The beginning
//         of the block has a header with a checksum and other data for
//         insuring the consistancy of the block. It is possible that
//         the last disk write did not operate correctly. The most likely
//         problem is that this is not a datafile for any database.
// *Action: Have operating system make correct file available to database.
//         If the trace file dump indicates that only the checksum is wrong,
//         restore from a backup and do media recovery.
01211, 00000, "version 6 data file is not from conversion to version 7"
// *Cause: The file is not a copy of the file last used under version 6. When
//         converting a database from version 6 to version 7 the conversion
//         utility must be run the last time the database is opened under
//         version 6. Only the datafiles that were current when the conversion
//         was done may be accessed by version 7. This datafile is either
//         a backup taken from before the conversion, or the database was
//         opened by version 6 after the conversion.
// *Action: Have operating system make correct data file available to database,
//         or repeat the version 6 to version 7 conversion.
01212, 00000, "MAXLOGMEMBERS may not exceed %s"
// *Cause:  MAXLOGMEMBERS specified on the command line too large.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with a smaller MAXLOGMEMBERS
01213, 00000, "MAXINSTANCES may not exceed %s"
// *Cause:  MAXINSTANCES specified on the command line too large.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with a smaller MAXINSTANCES
01214, 00000, "MAXLOGHISTORY may not exceed %s"
// *Cause:  MAXLOGHISTORY specified on the command line too large.
// *Action: Resubmit the command with a smaller MAXLOGHISTORY
01215, 00000, "enabled thread %s is missing after CREATE CONTROLFILE"
// *Cause:  A CREATE CONTROLFILE statement was given which did not
//          list all the enabled threads for the database.
// *Action: Reissue the CREATE CONTROLFILE statement, including all enabled
//          threads.
01216, 00000, "thread %s is expected to be disabled after CREATE CONTROLFILE"
// *Cause:  A thread that was given during CREATE CONTROLFILE is enabled, but
//          the datafiles indicate that it should be disabled.  This is
//          probably because the logs supplied to the CREATE CONTROLFILE
//          are old (from before the disabling of the thread).
// *Action: This thread is not required to run the database.  The CREATE
//          CONTROLFILE statement can be reissued without the problem thread,
//          and, if desired, the thread can be recreated after the database
//          is open.
01217, 00000, "logfile member belongs to a different logfile group"
// *Cause:  A member of a multiple-member logfile group specified in a
//          CREATE CONTROLFILE is not part of the same group as previous
//          members.
// *Action: Group together the correct members for the CREATE CONTROLFILE
//          command.
01218, 00000, "logfile member is not from the same point-in-time"
// *Cause:  A member of a multiple-member logfile group is from a different
//          point in time.  One of the members specified may be an older
//          (backup) copy of the log.
// *Action: Find the correct version of the log, or leave it out of the
//          CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
01219, 00000, "database not open: queries allowed on fixed tables/views only"
// *Cause:  A query was issued against an object not recognized as a fixed
//          table or fixed view before the database has been opened.
// *Action: Re-phrase the query to include only fixed objects, or open the
//          database.
01220, 00000, "file based sort illegal before database is open"
// *Cause:  A query issued against a fixed table or view required a temporary
//          segment for sorting before the database was open.  Only in-memory
//          sorts are supported before the database is open.
// *Action: Re-phrase the query to avoid a large sort, increase the
//          sort_area_size init.ora parameter to enable the sort to be
//          done in memory
01221, 00000, "data file %s is not the same file to a background process"
// *Cause:  When the database writer opens the data file, it is accessing a
//          different physical file than the foreground doing the recovery.
//          The timestamp set in the file header by the foreground was not
//          found by the background. It may be that the background process
//          could not read the file at all.
// *Action: Look in the DBWR trace file for the error it recieved when
//          attempting to read the file header. Reconfigure the operating
//          system as needed to have the file name successfully access the
//          same file when opened by a background process.
01222, 00000, "MAXINSTANCES of %s requires MAXLOGFILES be at least %s, not %s"
// *Cause:  Attemping to create a database or control file that does not have
//          room for at least two logs per thread of redo. A thread of redo
//          must have two online logs in order to be enabled. It does not make
//          sense to allow more redo threads than can be supported by the logs.
// *Action: Either reduce the MAXINSTANCES argument or increase MAXLOGFILES.
01223, 00000, "RESETLOGS must be specified to set a new database name"
// *Cause:  The SET database name option was specified to CREATE CONTROLFILE,
//          but RESETLOGS was not specified. The database name can only be
//          changed when opening the database with RESETLOGS.
// *Action: Either add the RESETLOGS option or drop the SET option to
//          CREATE CONTROLFILE.
01224, 00000, "group number in header %s does not match GROUP %s"
// *Cause: Group number specified at CREATE CONTROLFILE does not match the
//         group number stored in the header. Most likely the specification
//         is wrong.
// *Action: Omit the GROUP option or give the correct one.
01225, 00000, "thread number %s is greater than MAXINSTANCES %s"
// *Cause: The log is for a thread greater than the MAXINSTANCES argument.
// *Action:Increase the value for MAXINSTANCES and resubmit the command.
01226, 00000, "file header of log member is inconsistent with other members"
// *Cause: The log file member in the accompaning error is for the same group
//         as the previous members, but other fields in the header are
//         different. Either a file header is corrupted, or some file is a
//         member of a deleted log.
//*Action: Find the correct log member or omit this member from the command.
01227, 00000, "log %s is inconsistent with other logs"
// *Cause: The log file in the accompaning error is inconsistent with the 
//         contents of other logs given in the CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
//         Either a file header is corrupted, or some file is an old copy
//         rather than the current version. The problem may not be with the
//         log listed since all that can be detected is that there is an
//         inconsistancy. All log files listed in the command must be the
//         current versions of the online logs.
//*Action: Find the correct online logs or use the RESETLOGS option.
01228, 00000, "SET DATABASE option required to install seed database"
// *Cause: The SET DATABASE option was not included in the CREATE CONTROLFILE
//         command when installing a seed database. The database does not have
//         a database id because it is intended to be installed at multiple
//         sites, and each site needs to be a different database with its own
//         database id. Both the SET DATABASE and RESETLOGS options must be
//         specified to create the control file for this database.
//*Action: Resubmit command with the SET DATABASE and RESETLOGS options.
01229, 00000, "data file %s is inconsistent with logs"
// *Cause: The data file in the accompaning error is inconsistent with the 
//         contents of the logs given in the CREATE CONTROLFILE command.
//         The most likely cause is that one or more of the online logs
//         was missing from the command. It is also possible that one or
//         more of the logs is an old copy rather than the current version.
//         All online log files must be listed in the command and must be the
//         current versions of the online logs.
//*Action: Find the correct online logs or use the RESETLOGS option.
01230, 00000, "cannot make read only - file %s is offline"
// *Cause: An attempt to make a tablespace read only found that one of its
//         files is offline.
// *Action: Bring the file online and retry this command.
01231, 00000, "cannot make read write - file %s is offline"
// *Cause: An attempt to make a tablespace read write found that one of its
//         files is offline.
// *Action: Bring the file online and retry this command.
01232, 00000, "cannot start online backup - file %s is read only"
// *Cause: An attempt to start an online backup found that one of the files is
//        marked read only. Read only files do not need to be set into
//        online backup mode.
// *Action: Make the backup without the begin backup command.
01233, 00000, "file %s is read only - cannot recover using backup controlfile"
// *Cause: An attempt to do media recovery using a backup controlfile found
//        that one of the files is marked read only. Read only files do not
//        normally need to be recovered, but recovery with a backup
//        controlfile must recover all online files.
// *Action: If the file really is read only, take it offline before the
//         recovery, and bring the read only tablespace online after the
//         database is open. If the file does need recovery use a controlfile
//         from the time the file was read-write. If the correct controlfile
//         is not available, use CREATE CONTROLFILE to make one.
01234, 00000, "cannot end backup of file %s - file is in use or recovery"
// *Cause: Attempted to end an online backup of file when the file is busy.
//        Some operation such as recovery or rename may be active, or there
//        may still be some instance that has the database open with this
//        file online.
// *Action: If there is an instance with the database open then the backup
//        can be ended there by using the ALTER TABLESPACE command. Otherwise
//        wait for the completion of the other operation.
01235, 00000, "END BACKUP failed for %s file(s) and succeeded for %s"
// *Cause: One or more of the files in an end backup command failed. Some other
//        files given in the same command may have succeeded.
// *Action: See the accompanying error messages for the reason the backups
//        could not be ended. Any files not listed in the error messages were
//        successful.
01237, 00000, "cannot extend datafile %s"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred during the resize.
// *Action: Fix the cause of the operating system error and retry the command.
01238, 00000, "cannot shrink datafile %s"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred during the resize.
// *Action: The error is ignored, operation continues normally.
01239, 00000, "database must be in ARCHIVELOG mode to use external cache"
// *Cause:  An online file uses an external cache, but the database is in
//          NOARCHIVELOG mode. Since an external cache may require media
//          recovery this can not be allowed.
// *Action: Change database to be in ARCHIVELOG mode or do not use an
//          external cache.
01240, 00000, "too many data files to add in one command"
// *Cause:  The command specifies adding more data files than can be done in
//          one command. It is necessary to fit all the file names into one
//          log entry, but that would make the entry too large.
// *Action: If this is a CREATE TABLESPACE command, create with fewer files
//          then add the other files later. If this is an ADD DATAFILE command,
//          break it up into multiple commands.
01241, 00000, "an external cache has died"
// *Cause:  The external cache may have been restarted.
// *Action: Take the file mentioned in the error stack offline, perform media
//          recovery, bring the file online, and retry the attempted 
//          operation.  You may also restart all instances to make sure 
//          they access all data files through consistent external caches.
01242, 00000, "data file suffered media failure: database in NOARCHIVELOG mode"
// *Cause:  The database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode and a database file was
//          detected as inaccessible due to media failure.
// *Action: Restore accessibility to the file mentioned in the error stack
//          and restart the instance.
01243, 00000, "system tablespace file suffered media failure"
// *Cause:  A system tablespace file was detected as inaccessible due to
//          media failure.
// *Action: Restore accessibility to the file mentioned in the error stack
//          and restart the instance.
01244, 00000, "unnamed datafile(s) added to controlfile by media recovery"
// *Cause:  Media recovery with a backup controlfile or a controlfile that
//          was rebuilt, encountered the creation of a datafile that was not
//          in the controlfile. An entry has been added to the controlfile
//          for the new datafiles, but with the file name UNNAMEDnnnn, where
//          nnnn is the file number. Attached errors describe the file names
//          that were originally used to create the files. 
// *Action: Rename the files to valid file names and resume recovery. If
//          necessary the command ALTER DATABASE CREATE DATAFILE may be used
//          to create a file suitable for recovery and do the rename. If the
//          file is not going to be recovered then take it offline with the
//          DROP option.
01245, 00000, "offline file %s will be lost if RESETLOGS is done"
// *Cause:  Attempting to do an OPEN RESETLOGS with a file that will be lost
//          because it is offline. The file was not taken offline with the
//          DROP option.
// *Action: Either bring the file online and recover it, or take it offline
//          with the DROP option.

01409, 00000, "NOSORT option may not be used; rows are not in ascending order"
// *Cause: Creation of index with NOSORT option when rows were not ascending.
//         For non-unique indexes the rowid is considered part of the index
//         key. Therefore, if you create an index nosort and two of the rows
//         in the table have the same key and are stored in ascending order,
//         but get split accross two extents where the dba of the first block
//         in the second extent is less than the dba of the last block in the
//         first extent, then the create index nosort may fail. 
// *Action: Create the index without the NOSORT option, or ensure table is

// *Cause: Tried to drop system rollback segment
// *Action: None
01545, 00000, "rollback segment '%s' specified not available"
// *Cause: Either:
//         1) An attempt was made to bring a rollback segment online that is
//            unavailable during startup; for example, the rollback segment
//            is in an offline tablespace.
//         2) An attempt was made to bring a rollback segment online that is
//            already online.  This is because the rollback segment is
//            specified twice in the ROLLBACK_SEGMENTS parameter in the
//            initialization parameter file or the rollback segment is already
//            online by another instance.
//         3) An attempt was made to drop a rollback segment that is
//            currently online.
//         4) An attempt was made to alter a rollback segment that is
//            currently online to use unlimited extents.
// *Action: Either:
//         1) Make the rollback segment available; for example, bring an
//            offline tablespace online.
//         2) Remove the name from the ROLLBACK_SEGMENTS parameter if the name
//            is a duplicate or if another instance has already acquired the
//            rollback segment.
//         3) Bring the rollback segment offline first. This may involve
//            waiting for the active transactions to finish, or, if the
//            rollback segment needs recovery, discover which errors are
//            holding up the rolling back of the transactions and take
//            appropriate actions.
//         4) Same as 3).

// *Cause: Failed to remove all objects when dropping a tablespace
// *Action: Retry the drop tablespace until all objects are dropped
01562, 00000, "failed to extend rollback segment number %s"
// *Cause: Failure occurred when trying to extend rollback segment
// *Action: This is normally followed by another error message that caused
//	   the failure. Shutdown, restart and then take appropriate action for
//	   the error the caused the failure. If starting up the system
//	   again doesn't solve the problem, it is possible that there is

01567, 00000, "dropping log %s would leave less than 2 log files in thread %s"
// *Cause:  Dropping all the logs specified would leave fewer than the required
//	   two log files per enabled thread.
// *Action:  Either drop fewer logs or disable the thread before deleting the

// *Action: Specify a smaller MINEXTENTS value.
01571, 00000, "redo version %s incompatible with ORACLE version %s"
// *Cause:  This software version can not read the current redo logs, and
//          either crash recovery is required or there are offline database
//          files that need media recovery. If a file name is listed then
//          it needs media recovery.
// *Action: Shutdown and startup using the compatible software. Do any required
//          media recovery, and open the database. Shutdown and then startup

// *Action: The rollback segment extending will be rollbacked by the system,
//          no more extension will be possible untill the next extent is
//          freed up by rolling back or committing other transactions.
01582, 00000, "unable to open control file for backup"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred while attempting to open a
//	    control file for backup.
// *Action:  Check the error stack for more detailed information
01583, 00000, "unable to get block size of control file to be backed up"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred while attempting to
//	    get the block size of a control file for backup.
// *Action:  Check the error stack for more detailed information
01584, 00000, "unable to get file size of control file to be backed up"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred while attempting to
//	    get the file size of a control file for backup.
// *Action:  Check the error stack for more detailed information
01585, 00000, "error identifying backup file %s"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred when attempting to identify
//	    the file to be used for control file backup.
// *Action:  Check the error stack for more detailed information
01586, 00000, "unable to open destination file %s for backup"
// *Cause:  An operating system error occurred while attempting to open a
//	    control file for backup.
// *Action:  Check the error stack for more detailed information
01587, 00000, "error during control file backup file copy"
// *Cause:
//
// *Action:
01588, 00000, "must use RESETLOGS option for database open"
// *Cause: An earlier attempt to open the database with the RESETLOGS option
//         did not complete, or recovery was done with a control file backup.
// *Action: Use the RESETLOGS option when opening the database.
01589, 00000, "must use RESETLOGS or NORESETLOGS option for database open"
// *Cause:  Either incomplete or backup controlfile recovery has been
//          performed. After these types of recovery you must specify either
//          the RESETLOGS option or the NORESETLOGS option to open your
//          database.
// *Action: Specify the appropriate option.
01590, 00000, "number of segment free list (%s) exceeds maximum of %s"
// *Cause:  storage parameter FREELIST GROUPS is too large.
// *Action: Reduce storage parameters FREELIST GROUPS
01591, 00000, "lock held by in-doubt distributed transaction %s"
// *Cause:  Trying to access resource that is locked by a dead two-phase commit
//          transaction that is in prepared state.
// *Action: DBA should query the pending_trans$ and related tables, and attempt
//          to repair network connection(s) to coordinator and commit point.
//          If timely repair is not possible, DBA should contact DBA at commit
//          point if known or end user for correct outcome, or use heuristic
//          default if given to issue a heuristic commit or abort command to
//          finalize the local portion of the distributed transaction.
01592, 00000, "error converting Version 6 rollback segment (%s) to Oracle7 format"
// *Cause:  Look at the accompanying internal error; Version 6 database may not
//          have shutdown cleanly.
// *Action: Investigate the internal error; may have to reload the Version 6
//          database (from backup) and shutdown the database cleanly.
01593, 00000, "rollback segment optimal size (%s blks) is smaller than the computed initial size (%s blks)"
// *Cause:  Specified OPTIMAL size is smaller than the cumulative size of the
//          initial extents during create rollback segment.
// *Action: Specify a larger OPTIMAL size.
01594, 00000, "attempt to wrap into rollback segment (%s) extent (%s) which is being freed"
// *Cause:  Undo generated to free a rollback segment extent is attempting 
//          to write into the same extent due to small extents and/or too
//          many extents to free
// *Action: The rollback segment shrinking will be rollbacked by the system;
//          increase the optimal size of the rollback segment.
01595, 00000, "error freeing extent (%s) of rollback segment (%s))"
// *Cause:  Some error occurred while freeing inactive rollback segment extents.
// *Action: Investigate the accompanying error.
01596, 00000, "cannot specify system in %s parameter"
// *Cause:  The system rollback segment is specified in the init.ora parameter
//          referred to in the error message
// *Action: change the init.ora parameter
01597, 00000, "cannot alter system rollback segment online or offline"
// *Cause:  Tried to online or offline the system rollback segment
// *Action: None
01598, 00000, "rollback segment '%s' is not online"
// *Cause:  Could have been taken offline before by DBA or cleaned up
//          by SMON.
// *Action: Check the status of rollback segment in undo$ or dba_rollback_segs
//          to make sure the rollback segment is actually online.
01599, 00000, "failed to acquire rollback segment (%s), cache space is full (currently has (%s) entries)"
// *Cause:  the amount statically allocated is not enough based on
//          max_rollback_segments parameter.
// *Action: For now take another rollback segment offline or increase the 
//          parameter max_rollback_segments
01600, 00000, "at most one \"%s\" in clause \"%s\" of gc_files_to_locks"
// *Cause: init.ora parameter gc_files_to_locks mis-specified
// *Action:
01601, 00000, "illegal bucket size in clause \"%s\" of gc_files_to_locks"
// *Cause:
// *Action:

// *Cause:
// *Action:
01605, 00000, "missing file numbers in clause \"%s\" of gc_files_to_locks"
// *Cause:
// *Action:
01606, 00000, "gc_files_to_locks not identical to that of another mounted instance"
// *Cause:
// *Action:  Modify the init.ora parameter gc_files_to_locks and restart
01607, 00000, "gc_lck_procs (%s) is not the same as other instances (%s)"
// *Cause:  The gc_lck_procs init.ora parameter is not the same as in other
//	    instances that already have the database open.
// *Action: Modify the gc_lck_procs parameter and restart the instance.
01608, 00000, "cannot bring rollback segment '%s' online, its status is (%s)"
// *Cause:  Could have been brought online before by DBA or left as a result
//          of process crash.
// *Action: Check the status of rollback segment in undo$ or dba_rollback_segs
01609, 00000, "log %s is the current log for thread %s - cannot drop members"
// *Cause:  A member of the current log for a thread cannot be dropped.
// *Action: If the thread is opened, request a log switch by the instance
//          that is using it.  If it is not open, disable the thread, manually
//          archive the log, or clear it.
01610, 00000, "recovery using the BACKUP CONTROLFILE option must be done"
// *Cause:  Either an earlier database recovery session specified BACKUP
//          CONTROLFILE, or the control file was recreated with the RESETLOGS
//          option, or the control file being used is a backup control file.
//	    After that only BACKUP CONTROLFILE recovery is allowed
//          and it must be followed by a log reset at the next database open.
// *Action: Perform recovery using the BACKUP CONTROFILE option.
01611, 00000, "thread number %s is invalid - must be between 1 and  %s"
// *Cause:  A thread number in a command is greater than the number of threads
//          supported by the control file.
// *Action: Use a thread number that is valid
01612, 00000, "thread %s is already enabled"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to enable a thread that is already enabled.
// *Action: Either use this thread or enable another thread.
01613, 00000, "thread %s only has %s logs - at least 2 logs required to enable"
// *Cause:  The thread cannot be enabled because it only has two online log
//          files associated with it.
// *Action: Add logs to the thread or pick another thread to enable
01614, 00000, "thread %s is busy - cannot enable"
// *Cause:  The mount enqueue for the thread could not be acquired when
//          attempting to enable the thread. This probably means that another
//          process has already started enabling this thread.
// *Action: Wait and try again, or find another thread to enable.
01615, 00000, "thread %s is mounted - cannot disable"
// *Cause:  Some instance, possibly this one, has allocated the thread for its
//          use. The thread may not be disabled while in use.
// *Action: Shutdown cleanly the instance using the thread.
01616, 00000, "thread %s is open - cannot disable"
// *Cause:  The thread is not closed. The last instance to use the thread died
//          leaving the thread open. A thread cannot be disabled until it is
//          closed. It is still required for crash or instance recovery.
// *Action: If the database is open, instance recovery should close the thread
//          soon - wait a few minutes. Otherwise open the database - crash
//          recovery will close the thread.
01617, 00000, "cannot mount: %s is not a valid thread number"
// *Cause:  The init.ora parameter "thread" is not between 1 and the number
//          of threads allowed when the database was created.
// *Action: Shutdown the instance, change the init.ora parameter and startup
01618, 00000, "thread %s is not enabled - cannot mount"
// *Cause:  The init.ora parameter "thread" requests a thread that is not
//          enabled. A thread must be enabled before it can be mounted.
// *Action: Shutdown the instance, change the init.ora parameter and startup
//          mounting a different thread. If the database is open in another
//          instance then the thread may be enabled.
01619, 00000, "thread %s is mounted by another instance"
// *Cause:  The init.ora parameter "thread" requests a thread that has been
//          mounted by another instance. Only one instance may use a thread.
// *Action: Shutdown the instance, change the init.ora parameter and startup
//          mounting a different thread.
01620, 00000, "no public threads are available for mounting"
// *Cause:  The init.ora parameter "thread" is zero, its default value.
//          There are no threads which have been publicly enabled, and not
//          mounted.
// *Action: Shutdown the instance, change the init.ora parameter to a thread
//          which is privately enabled and not mounted. If the database is
//          open in another instance, then a thread may be publicly enabled.
01621, 00000, "cannot rename member of current log if database is open"
// *Cause:  This is a rename command for  a member of the current log for
//          an open thread.  If the database is open anywhere, the log may be
//          in use, so the rename cannot be done.
// *Action: Wait until the log is not current, or mount the database
//          exclusively.
01622, 00000, "thread number must be specified - default not specific"
// *Cause:  The thread was not specified when adding a log, and the currently
//          mounted thread was chosen by default at mount time. Since the
//          current thread was not specified explicitly the user cannot know
//          which thread the log will be added to.
// *Action: Explicitly specify the thread number either in the init.ora
//          parameter "thread", or in the add command.
01623, 00000, "log %s is current log for thread %s - cannot drop"
// *Cause:  A thread's current log cannot be dropped even if the thread is
//          closed. A disabled thread usually does not have a current log,
//          but a half completed disable may need to be disabled again.
// *Action: If the database is not open then disable the thread. If the
//          database is open and an instance has the thread open, then the
//          instance can be requested to switch logs. If the database is
//          closed the log can be archived or cleared to force a switch.
01624, 00000, "log %s needed for crash recovery of thread %s"
// *Cause:  A log cannot be dropped or cleared until the thread's checkpoint
//          has advanced out of the log.
// *Action: If the database is not open then open it. Crash recovery will
//          advance the checkpoint. If the database is open force a global
//          checkpoint. If the log is corrupted so that the database cannot
//          be opened, it may be necessary to do incomplete recovery until
//          cancel at this log.
01625, 00000, "rollback segment '%s' does not belong to this instance"
// *Cause:  Trying to shrink or take a rollback segment offline that does not 
//          belong to this instance.
// *Action: 
01626, 00000, "rollback segment number '%s' cannot handle more transactions"
// *Cause:  Too many transactions in this segment.
// *Action: Choose a different rollback segment, or reduce the number 
//          of concurrent transactions. 
01627, 00000, "rollback segment number '%s' is not online"
// *Cause:  Could have been taken offline before by DBA or cleaned up
//          by SMON.
// *Action: Check the status of rollback segment in undo$ or dba_rollback_segs
//          to make sure the rollback segment is actually online.
01628, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached for rollback segment %s"
// *Cause:  Tried to extend rollback segment already at maxexents value
// *Action: If maxextents storage parameter less than system allowable max, 
//          raise this value. Consider upping the pctincrease value as well.
01629, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached saving undo for tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Save undo for the offline tablespace at max extents
// *Action: Check the storage parameters for the system tablespace. The
//          tablespace needs to be brought back online so the undo can be
//          applied .
01630, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached in temp segment in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  A temp segment tried to extend past max extents.
// *Action: If maxextents for the tablespace is less than the the system
//          maximum, you can raise that. Otherwise, raise pctincrease for the 
//          tablespace
01631, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached in table %s.%s"
// *Cause:  A table tried to extend past maxextents
// *Action: If maxextents is less than the system maximum, raise it. Otherwise,
//          you must recreate with larger initial, next or pctincrease params
01632, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached in index %s.%s"
// *Cause:  An index tried to extend past maxextents
// *Action: If maxextents is less than the system max, raise it. Otherwise,
//          you must recreate with larger initial, next or pctincrease params.
01633, 00000, "parallel Server Option needed for this operation"
// *Cause: System doesn't have parallel server configured
// *Action: Obtain parallel server option
01634, 00000, "rollback segment number '%s' is about to go offline"
// *Cause:  The rollback segment specified was marked to go offline by DBA.
// *Action: Bring the rollback segment online first.
01635, 00000, "rollback segment #%s specified not available"
// *Cause: (same as 1545)
// *Action: (same as 1545)
01636, 00000, "rollback segment '%s' is already online"
// *Cause: The instance is trying to online an already online RS
// *Action:
01637, 00000, "rollback segment '%s' is being used by another instance (#%s)"
// *Cause: The instance is trying to online a RS already in use by another 
//         instance
// *Action:
01638, 00000, "parameter %s does not allow ORACLE version %s to mount parallel"
// *Cause: The recovery compatible parameter is set too low to allow this
//         software version to do a parallel mount.
// *Action:Either use an earlier software release or advance the
//         recovery_compatible parameter. If this happens when no
//         recovery_compatible parameter has been specified then set it 
//         to the current software release.
01639, 00000, "database cannot be mounted parallel with no lock processes"
// *Cause: The value of gc_lck_procs is 0, and the database is being mounted
//         in parallel mode.
// *Action: Change  gc_lck_procs to a value between 1 and 10, or leave it
//         it undefined to use the builtin default.
01640, 00000, "cannot make tablespace read only with active transactions"
// *Cause: Attempting to make a tablespace read only while there are active
//         transactions in the database. All transactions must commit or
//         rollback to insure that there is no undo for a tablespace before
//         it can be made read only. This includes in doubt distributed
//         transactions.
// *Action: Prevent any more transactions from being started. Putting the
//         database in restricted mode usually helps. If there are any in
//         doubt transactions they must also be resolved.
01641, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is not online - cannot add data file"
// *Cause: Attempting to add a datafile to a tablespace that has been set
//         to read only or offline.
// *Action: Make the tablespace online and read write then add the datafile.
01642, 00000, "begin backup not needed for read only tablespace '%s'"
// *Cause: Attempting to begin or end a backup for a tablespace that has
//         been set to read only.
// *Action: Take the backup without any begin or end commands. The files
//         are not being modified so the backup will be consistent.
01643, 00000, "system tablespace can not be made read only"
// *Cause: Attempting to set the system tablespace to read only. The system
//         tablespace must remain read write for database operation.
// *Action: Leave system tablespace read write.
01644, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is already read only"
// *Cause: Attempting to make tablespace read only that is already read only.
// *Action: Leave tablespace read only, or make read write then make
//         read only again.
01645, 00000, "previous attempt to make read write is half complete"
// *Cause: A failure while making the tablespace read write left it read
//         only, but the checkpoint was advanced. The tablespace will not
//         be useable after a resetlogs if its files are offline.
// *Action: Repeat the command to make the tablespace read write.
01646, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is not read only - cannot make read write"
// *Cause: Attempting to make a tablespace read write that is not read only.
//         It may be either online or offline.
// *Action: Leave tablespace read write.
01647, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is read only, cannot allocate space in it"
// *Cause: Tried to allocate space in a read only tablespace
// *Action: Create the object in another tablespace
01648, 00000, "log %s is the current log of disabled thread %s"
// *Casue: An attempt to enable the thread failed after it was half completed.
//         This log was left as the current log even though the thread is still
//         disabled. Since a log switch cannot be done until the thread is
//         enabled, the log can not be cleared or archived.
// *Action:Complete the thread enable by issuing the enable command again.
01649, 00000, "operation not allowed with a backup control file"
// *Cause: An attempt is being made to preform a command that does not make
//         sense when the control file is a restored backup.
// *Action:Wait until after the database has been opened and try again.
01650, 00000, "unable to extend rollback segment %s by %s in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to allocate an extent for rollback segment in tablespace.
// *Action: Use ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE statement to add one or more
//         files to the tablespace indicated.
01651, 00000, "unable to extend save undo segment by %s for tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to allocate an extent for saving undo entries for
//          the indicated offline tablespace.
// *Action: Check the storage parameters for the SYSTEM tablespace. The
//          tablespace needs to be brought back online so the undo can be
//          applied.
01652, 00000, "unable to extend temp segment by %s in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to allocate an extent for temp segment in tablespace.

01655, 00000, "unable to extend cluster %s.%s by %s in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to allocate an extent for cluster segment in tablespace.
// *Action: Use ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE statement to add one or more
//         files to the tablespace indicated.
01656, 00000, "max # extents (%s) reached in cluster %s.%s"
// *Cause:  A cluster tried to extend past maxextents
// *Action: If maxextents is less than the system maximum, raise it. Otherwise,
//          you must recreate with larger initial, next or pctincrease params
01657, 00000, "invalid SHRINK option value"
// *Cause: The specified value must be an integer.
// *Action:  Choose an appropriate integer value.
01658, 00000, "unable to create INITIAL extent for segment in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to find sufficient contiguous space to allocate INITIAL 
//          extent for segment being created.
// *Action: Use ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE to add additional space to the 
//          tablespace or retry with a smaller value for INITIAL
01659, 00000, "unable to allocate MINEXTENTS beyond %s in tablespace %s"
// *Cause:  Failed to find sufficient contiguous space to allocate MINEXTENTS
//          for the segment being created.
// *Action: Use ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE to add additional space to the
//          tablespace or retry with smaller value for MINEXTENTS, NEXT or
//          PCTINCREASE
01660, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is already permanent"
// *Cause: Attempting to make tablespace permanent that is already permanent.
// *Action: Leave tablespace permanent.
01661, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is already temporary"
// *Cause: Attempting to make tablespace temporary that is already temporary.
// *Action: Leave tablespace permanent.
01662, 00000, "tablespace '%s' is non-empty and cannot be made temporary"
// *Cause: Tried to convert a non-empty tablespace to a temporary tablespace
// *Action: To drop all the objects in the tablespace.
01663, 00000, "the contents of tablespace '%s' is constantly changing"
// *Cause: The contents of the tablespace is always changing between PERMANENT
//         and TEMPORARY.
// *Action: To decide what the tablespace contents should be and stay with it.
01664, 00000, "Transaction which has expanded the Sort Segment has aborted"
// *Cause: Internal Error.
// *Action: Contact Oracle Support.
01665, 00000, "controlfile is not a standby controlfile"
// *Cause:  Attempting to mount, recover or activate a standby database
//          without a standby controlfile.
// *Action: Create a standby controlfile before attempting to use the database
//          as a standby database.
01666, 00000, "controlfile is for a standby database"
// *Cause:  Attempting to mount, recover, or open a standby database without
//          the appropriate command option to designate a standby database.
// *Action: Use the standby option or appropriate commands, or mount with 
//          the primary controlfile.
01667, 00000, "redo log is incompatible with standby database"
// *Cause:  Recovery of a standby database has encountered redo from the
//          primary database that does not support the standby database option.
// *Action: Change the compatible initialization parameter for the primary
//          database to be 7.3.0 or greater, open the primary database, and
//          rebuild the standby database.
01668, 00000, "standby database requires DROP option for offline of data file"
// *Cause:  Attempting to take a datafile offline in a standby database without
//          specifying the DROP option. Files that are offline in a standby
//          database are not recovered, and are likely to be unusable if
//          the standby is activated. Note that specifying DROP does not
//          prevent bringing the file online later.
// *Action: Specify the DROP option or leave the file online.
01669, 00000, "standby database control file not consistent"
// *Cause:  Attempting to activate a standby database with a control file that
//          has not been recovered to the same point as the data files. Most
//          likely the control file was just copied from the primary database
//          and has not been used for recovery.
// *Action: Recover the standby database until all the files are consistent.
01670, 00000, "new datafile %s needed for standby database recovery"
// *Cause:  Standby database recovery noticed that a file was added to the
//          primary database, but is not available on the standby.
// *Action: Either copy the file from the primary database or do an ALTER
//          DATABASE CREATE DATAFILE command on the standby to create a
//          file to recover.
01671, 00000, "controlfile is a backup, cannot make a standby controlfile"
// *Cause:  The currently mounted control file is a backup control file, and
//          attempting to create a control file for a standby database.
// *Action: Complete any needed recovery and open the database with the
//          resetlogs option.
01672, 00000, "controlfile may be missing files or have extra ones"
// *Cause:  Attempting to create a standby control file, but the controlfile
//          was either recently created via CREATE CONTROLFILE or an incomplete
//          recovery has been done. Thus the datafiles in the controlfile
//          and the ones in the data dictionary may not match.
// *Action: Open the database, then retry the operation.
01673, 00000, "data file %s has not been identified"
// *Cause:  This data file was not in the control file after an incomplete
//          recovery or CREATE CONTROLFILE. Since information from its
//          header is needed for standby database recovery, we can not
//          create a standby controlfile.
// *Action: Find the file and bring it online. If desired it may be taken
//          offline again. If you intend to drop this file, then taking it
//          offline with the DROP option will avoid this error.
01674, 00000, "data file %s is an old incarnation rather than current file"
// *Cause:  Recovery encountered redo that indicates this file was dropped
//          from the database and another file was added using the same file
//          number. This implies that a CREATE CONTROLFILE command was given
//          the old file which was dropped rather than the latest file.
// *Action: Rebuild the controlfile using CREATE CONTROLFILE, and give the
//          correct file.

01676, 00000, "standby file name convert of '%s' exceeds maximum length of %s"
// *Cause:  When the given file name is converted to the name used for the
//          standby database, the converted name is bigger than the maximum
//          allowed file name.
// *Action: Change initialization parameter DB_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT or
//          LOG_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT to convert to a valid file name.
01677, 00000, "standby file name convert parameters differ from other instance"
// *Cause: The DB_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT or LOG_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT
//         initialization parameters are not the same as in other instances
//         that already have the database mounted.
// *Action: Change initialization parameters DB_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT and
//          LOG_FILE_STANDBY_NAME_CONVERT to match other instances.
01678, 00000, "parameter %s must be two strings, a pattern and a replacement"
// *Cause: The initialization parameter does not have 2 strings for its value.
//         The first string it a pattern to be found in file names. The second
//         string is used to replace the pattern when found in file names.
// *Action:Specify two strings for the parameter, or omit the parameter.
01679, 00000, "database must be mounted EXCLUSIVE and not open to activate"
// *Cause: An attempt to activate a standby database was made when the 
//        database was not mounted EXCLUSIVE or was already open.
// *Action: Mount the database EXCLUSIVE and retry the ACTIVATE command.
01680, 00000, "gc_db_locks cannot be zero if gc_files_to_locks is used"
// *Cause: Setting gc_db_locks to zero makes data blocks in all files
//         releasable, so specifying gc_files_to_locks is redundant.
// *Action: Remove either gc_db_locks or gc_files_to_locks.

// *Action: increase the init.ora "distributed_transactions" or run fewer 
//      transactions.  If you are sure you don't have too many concurrent
//      distributed transactions, this indicates an internal error and support
//      should be notified.  Instance shutdown/restart would be a work-around.
02043, 00000, "must end current transaction before executing %s" 
// *Cause: a transaction is in progress and one of the following commands

//         with a previous distributed tran.
02047, 00000, "cannot join the distributed transaction in progress"
// *Cause: Either a transaction is in progress against a remote database
//         that does not fully support two phase commit, and an update
//         is attempted on another database, or updates are pending and
//         and an attempt is made to update a different database that

// *Action: rollback to a savepoint or rollback transaction and resubmit
02056, 00000, "2PC: %s: bad two-phase command number %s from %s"

02066, 00000, "missing or invalid MTS_DISPATCHERS text"
// *Cause: A character string literal was expected, but not found, following
//	   ALTER SYSTEM SET MTS_DISPATCHERS
// *Action: place the string literal containing the dispatcher's specification
//          after ALTER SYSTEM SET MTS_DISPATCHERS
02067, 00000, "transaction or savepoint rollback required"
// *Cause: A failure (typically a trigger or stored procedure with multiple

02079, 00000, "no new sessions may join a committing distributed transaction"
// *Cause: A call to UPI2BG was issued in a session for a transaction that
//         has begun to commit in a different branch; that is, a call to 
//         upi2en was issued for a branch of the same transaction in another
//         session.  This can only happen when using an external transaction
//         manager.
// *Action: Contact support.
// 
02080, 00000, "database link is in use"
// *Cause: a transaction is active or a cursor is open on the database link
//  given in the alter session close database link <link> command.
// *Action: commit or rollback, and close all cursors
//
02081, 00000, "database link is not open"
// *Cause: dblink given is not currently open.
//
02082, 00000, "a loopback database link must have a connection qualifier"
// *Cause: attempt to create a database link with the same name as the
//  current database.
// *Action: a loopback database link needs a trailing qualifier, e.g.

// *Cause: database/database link name can have at most 128 characters.
02087, 00000, "object locked by another process in same transaction"
// *Cause: A database link is being used in the parallel server environment
//	   that loops back to the same instance.  One session is trying
//         to convert a lock that was obtained by the other session.
// *Action: Get the more restrictive lock first.  For example, if
//          session 1 gets a share lock and session 2 gets an exclusive lock
//          on the same object, get the exclusive lock first.  Or, simply
//          use the same session to access the object.

// *Cause: Also see error 2092. If the transaction is aborted at a remote
//         site then you will only see 2091; if aborted at host then you will
//         see 2092 and 2091.
// *Action: Add rollback segment and retry the transaction.
02092, 00000, "out of transaction table slots for distributed transaction"
// *Cause: The transaction is assigned to the system rollback segment and is
//         trying to get into the PREPARED state, but the required number
//         of non-PREPARED slots are not available, hence the transaction
//         is rolled back.

//         snapshots, deferred RPCs, and other replication features were,     
//         therefore, unavailable. 
// *Action: Install the replication option. The replication option is not      
//          part of the Oracle7 Server product and must be purchased
//          separately. Contact an Oracle Sales representative if the

// *Action: This is a programming error - use either a positive number or
//          zero to get the default value.
2827, 00000, "Invalid file number"
// *Cause:  The file number upon which an operation is to done is either
//          less than zero or greater than the maximum number of files than
//          can be open.
// *Action: This is a programming error. Since the calling program should
//          not touch this number, this is a programming error.
2828, 00000, "Segment free list is empty"
// *Cause:  No segments are available to allocated.
// *Action: Free some segments or shut down the package and re-initialize it
//          with a higher number of segments.
2829, 00000, "No segment of the proper size is available"
// *Cause:  No segment of the proper size is ready for use by the caller.
// *Action: Free some segments and try again.
2830, 00000, "Segment could not be split - no free segments available"
// *Cause:  A segment that is larger than that desired could not be split
//          because no free segment was available.
// *Action: Free some segments and try again.
2831, 00000, "Segment deallocation failed - empty segment list"
// *Cause:  The caller attempted to deallocate a segment but the "in use"
//          list was empty. This is a programming error.
// *Action: Check the calling program.
2832, 00000, "Segment deallocation failed - segment not on list"
// *Cause:  The caller attempted to deallocate a segment that was not on the

// *Cause:  A server exited during its initialization process.
// *Action: Check the servers' logs for more information.
2842, 00000, "Client unable to fork a server"
// *Cause:  The client could not spawn a server. A possible reason is that
//          the operating system has reached its limit on the number of
//          processes that it can spawn.
// *Action: Either reduce the number of servers that are to be used,
//          or reconfigure the operating system so that it can handle more
//          processes.
2843, 00000, "Invalid value for kernel flag"
// *Cause:  An illegal value was given for the kernel flag in the information
//          structure. Only TRUE and FALSE are permitted.
// *Action: This is a programming error - check the calling routine.
2844, 00000, "Invalid value for the leave open flag"
// *Cause:  A value was given for the flag that determines whether a file is
//          to be left open after the client checks it to see if the servers
//          can use it. Only TRUE and FALSE are supported.
// *Action: This is a programming error - check the calling routine.
2845, 00000, "Invalid value for the timing wanted flag"
// *Cause:  A value was given for the flag that indicates that operations are

// *Action: If the function is a packaged, PL/SQL function: Recreate
//          the function and include a pragma containing the 'Write no
//          Package State' (WNPS).
//          If the function is a stand-alone, PL/SQL function: Delete
//          the function from the SQL statement.
06574, 00000, "Function %s references package state, cannot execute remotely"
// *Cause:  There are two possible causes for this message:
//          * A remote, packaged function or a remote-mapped, local,
//            packaged function that does not contain a pragma with the
//            'Write no Package State' (WNPS) and 'Read no Package State'
//            (RNPS) arguments references a package state.
//          * A remote, stand-alone function or a remote-mapped, local,
//            stand-alone function contains a reference to a package
//            state (reads or writes a package variable).
//          Only local functions that are referenced in a SELECT list, VALUES
//          clause of an INSERT statement, or SET clause of an UPDATE
//          statement can modify a package state.
// *Action: If the function is a packaged function: Recreate the function
//          and include a pragma containing the 'Write no Package State'
//          (WNPS) and 'Read no Package State' (RNPS) arguments. 
//          If the function is a stand-alone function: Do not call the
//          function.
06575, 00000, "Package or function %s is in an invalid state"
// *Cause:  A SQL statement references a PL/SQL function that is in an
//          invalid state. Oracle attempted to compile the function, but
//          detected errors.
// *Action: Check the SQL statement and the PL/SQL function for syntax
//          errors or incorrectly assigned, or missing, privileges for a
//          referenced object.

06580, 00000, "Hash Join ran out of memory while keeping large rows in memory"
// *Cause:  Hash Join reserves 3 slots (each slot size = DB_BLOCK_SIZE * 
//          HASH_JOIN_MULTIBLOCK_IO_COUNT) for a row. If a row is larger than
//          that, this error will be raised.
// *Action: Increase HASH_JOIN_MULTIBLOCK_IO_COUNT so that each joined row 
//          fits in a slot. HASH_AREA_SIZE may also need to be increaed.

12315, 00000, "database link type is invalid for the ALTER DATABASE statement"
// *Cause:  The database link name you specified on the ALTER DATABASE 
//          statement is not an ROM: link.  You must specify an ROM: link 
//          when using the ALTER DATABASE statement to mount or open a 
//	    secondary database.
// *Action:  Re-issue the ALTER DATABASE statement using a valid ROM: link to
//	    the database you want to mount or open.  If a valid ROM: link does
//          not exist, create one using the CREATE DATABASE LINK
// 	    command.  See the Trusted ORACLE RDBMS Guide to Security Features
//          for more information about creating database links using 
//	    the ROM: link type.
12316, 00000, "syntax error in database link's connect string"
// *Cause:  The connect string in the CREATE DATABASE LINK statement 
//          has a syntactical error. 
// *Action:  Drop the database link and recreate it using valid syntax.  See 
//	     the SQL Language Reference Manual for more information about the
//	     connect string portion of the CREATE DATABASE LINK 
//           statement.
12317, 00000, "logon to database (link name %s) denied"
// *Cause:  There are several possible causes for this error.  First, you can
// 	    get this error if your username (and password, if you are using 
//          database instead of operating system authentication) in the 
//	    secondary database are not identical
//	    to your username (and password) in the primary database.  Second, 
//          you can get this error if your username in the secondary database 
//          is invalid (has not been created).  Third,
//	    you can get this error if the username/password combination 
//	    specified in the connect string of the database link definition
//	    is invalid (either not created or has an invalid password).
// *Action: In the first case, ensure that the secondary database contains
//	    a username (and password, if you are using database authentication)
//          identical to the one you are using in the primary
//          database.  In general, you should always use operating system
//	    authentication in Trusted ORACLE (see the Trusted ORACLE RDBMS
//	    Guide to Security Features for more information about the
//          advantages of OS authentication).
//	    In the second case, ensure that your username in the 
//          secondary database has been created.
//	    In the third case, ensure that the username specified in the
//	    connect string has been created in the secondary database.
12318, 00000, "database (link name %s) is already mounted"
// *Cause:  You are attempting to mount a secondary database that has already
//	    been mounted by your instance.
// *Action:  The database is already mounted, so you need not take additional
//	     action to mount it.  To establish access, use the 
//	     ALTER DATABASE <linkname> OPEN command to open the database.
12319, 00000, "database (link name %s) is already open"
// *Cause:  You are attempting to open a secondary database that is already
//	    open.
// *Action:  The database is open and you need not take additional action
//           to establish access.
12321, 00000, "database (link name %s) is not open and AUTO_MOUNTING=FALSE"
// *Cause:  The secondary database that your instance is attempting to mount 
//	    is not open and automatic mounting has not been enabled.  
// *Action: Manually mount and open the secondary database using 
//	    ALTER DATABASE <linkname> with the OPEN and MOUNT options.  
//          Alternately, to allow your instance to automatically mount and 
//	    open secondary databases, set the AUTO_MOUNTING parameter in the 
//          parameter file to TRUE.  
12322, 00000, "unable to mount database (link name %s)"
// *Cause:   This message should be accompanied by additional error messages 
//	     that indicate the cause of the problem.  
// *Action:  Follow the steps outlined in the accompanying error messages to 
//	     resolve the problem.  
12323, 00000, "unable to open database (link name %s)"
// *Cause:   This message should be accompanied by additional error messages 
//	     that indicate the cause of the problem.  
// *Action:  Follow the steps outlined in the accompanying error messages to 
//	     resolve the problem.
12324, 00000, "cannot use the ROM: link type on a private database link"
// *Cause:  You can only specify the ROM: link type on a public, not a 
//	    private, database link.  
// *Action:  Determine if there is an existing public database link to the
//           secondary database.  If not, and if you wish to establish public
//           access to the secondary database, create a public database link to
//           the secondary database using the CREATE DATABASE LINK
//	     command. 
12326, 00000, "database %s is closing immediately;  no operations are permitted"
// *Cause:  The database you attempted to access is closing, so your 
//	    operation has been terminated.
// *Action:  Wait until the database has been reopened, or contact the 
//	     database adminstrator.
12329, 00000, "database %s is closed;  no operations are permitted"
// *Cause:  The database you attempted to access is closed, so your
//	    operation has been terminated.
// *Action:  Wait until the database is reopened, or contact the database
//	     administrator.
12333, 00000, "database (link name %s) is not mounted"
// *Cause:  You attempted to open a database that has not been mounted.
// *Action:  Mount the database with the ALTER DATABASE <linkname> MOUNT
//	     command, then re-attempt to open the database.
12334, 00000, "database (link name %s) is still open"
// *Cause:  You attempted to dismount a database that is still open.
// *Action:  Close the database with the ALTER DATABASE <linkname> CLOSE
//	     command, then re-attempt to dismount the database.
12335, 00000, "database (link name %s) is not open"
// *Cause:  You attempted to close a database that is not open.
// *Action:  The database is closed;  you can proceed with dismounting it.
12336, 00000, "cannot login to database (link name %s) "
// *Cause:  You are tyring to login while another user is mounting or 
//          dismounting the same database.
// *Action: Check to see if the database is in the middle of being 
//          mounted or opened and try your login again once the database is
//          accessible.
12341, 00000, "maximum number of open mounts exceeded"
// *Cause:  The number specified on the OPEN_MOUNTS parameter in the parameter
//	    file exceeds the maximum allowed (255).
// *Action: Change the value of this parameter so that it reflects the actual
//	    number of possible open mounts to secondary databases.  This must 
//	    be less than 255.
12342, 00000, "open mounts exceeds limit set on the OPEN_MOUNTS parameter"
// *Cause:  The number of currently open mounts exceeds the value you 
//	    specified on the OPEN_MOUNTS parameter.
// *Action: Increase the value of the OPEN_MOUNTS parameter so that it 
//	    accommodates the maximum possible number of open mounts to
//	    secondary databases.
12345, 00000, "user %s lacks CREATE SESSION privilege in database link (linkname %s)"
// *Cause: There are several possible causes for this message:
//         First, you will get this message if your username in the
//         second database specified was not granted the
//         CREATE SESSION system privilege.
//         Second, you will get this message if the username specified
//         in the connect string of the database link definition was
//         not granted the CREATE SESSION system privilege.
// *Action: The action you take depends upon the cause of the message:
//         In the first case, ensure that your username in the secondary
//         database was granted the CREATE SESSION system privilege.
//         In the second case, ensure the username specified in the
//         connect string of the database link definition was granted
//         the CREATE SESSION system privilege in the secondary database.
12350, 00000, "database link being dropped is still mounted"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to drop a ROM: database link that was still
//          mounted and/or opened.
// *Action: Close and dismount the database and then re-issue the drop 
//          statement.
12351, 00000, "cannot create view using a remote object which has a remote object reference"
// *Cause:  You tried to create a view which references a remote object
//          which, in turn, references an object on another database.  Since
//          the view that you tried to create references a remote object,
//          that object cannot reference an object on another database.
// *Action: Choose a different object to reference in your view or change
//          the remote object so that it does not reference another database.
12352, 00000, "object %s.%s@%s is invalid"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to reference (compile against) an object
//          of a secondary database but the object is invalid and the system
//          cannot validate or recompile it because it is in a secondary
//          database.
// *Action: Manually recompile the invalid object in the secondary database.
12353, 00000, "secondary stored object cannot reference remote object"
// *Cause:  You tried to either select from a remote view or execute a remote
//          procedure which references an object on another database.  Since
//          the remote view or procedure is on a secondary database, an 
//          additional reference to another database cannot be done.
// *Action: Choose a different object to reference or change the remote
//          view or procedure so that it does not reference another database.
12354, 00000, "secondary object being dropped"
// *Cause:  You tried to access a object (for example, a table or view)
//          on a secondary database that was in the process of being
//          dropped.
// *Action: Repeat the operation.  If you receive this message again, try to
//          access the object from the secondary database.  If you receive
//          an internal error or a trace file, contact Oracle WorldWide
//          Technical Support.

12400, 00000, "DBLOW is not a valid operating system label"
// *Cause:  The operating system label corresponding to DBLOW has become
//          invalid due to a change in operating system label definitions.
// *Action: Use the operating system facilities to restore the definition
//          of this label, or change the value of DBLOW to a valid label.
//          To change the value of DBLOW, you must mount the database and 
//          switch to OSMAC mode.
12401, 00000, "DBHIGH is not a valid operating system label"
// *Cause:  The operating system label corresponding to DBHIGH has become
//          invalid due to a change in operating system label definitions.
// *Action: Use the operating system facilities to restore the definition
//          of this label, or change the value of DBHIGH to a valid label.
//          To change the value of DBHIGH, you must mount the database and 
//          switch to OSMAC mode.
12402, 00000, "file: %s"
// *Cause: Reporting file name for detail of another message.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for additional detail.
12403, 00000, "file label (%s) must be equal to DBHIGH (%s)"
// *Cause:  An ORACLE file was found to have a label that does not match
//          the operating system equivalent of DBHIGH.
//          This may be caused if DBHIGH has been changed, or if the file
//          has been relabeled.
// *Action: Either relabel the file so that its label matches DBHIGH, or
//          alter DBHIGH so that it matches the label on the file.
12404, 00000, "device low (%s) must be dominated by DBLOW (%s)"
// *Cause:  A ORACLE file was found on a device with an authorized range
//          insufficient to handle the lowest labeled data in the file.  DBLOW
//          must always dominate the minimum device label.
// *Action: Lower the authorized minimum device label or move the file
//          to a different device.
12405, 00000, "device high (%s) must dominate DBHIGH (%s)"
// *Cause:  An ORACLE file was found on a device with an authorized range
//          insufficient to handle the highest labeled data in the file.
//          DBHIGH must always be dominated by the maximum device label.
// *Action: Raise the authorized maximum device label or move the file
//          to a different device.
12406, 00000, "must be at DBHIGH (%s) in OS to add files to a tablespace"
// *Cause: A file was added to a new or existing tablespace by a user
//         whose operating system label was not equal to DBHIGH.
// *Action: Log in to the operating system at DBHIGH to add the file.
//          If you are creating a new tablespace, set your session label
//          to the label at which you want the tablespace to be created,
//          then create the tablespace.  If you are adding a file to an
//          existing tablespace, set your session label to match the
//          creation label of the tablespace, then alter the tablespace
//          See the Trusted ORACLE Administrator's Guide for more detailed
//          information about creating and altering tablespaces.
12407, 00000, "cannot insert or update the ROWLABEL column of a view"
// *Cause:  You tried to insert into or update the ROWLABEL column of
//          a view.  Trusted ORACLE does not allow you to modify the ROWLABEL
//          column of a view.
// *Action: While you cannot modify the ROWLABEL column of a view, you can
//          modify the ROWLABEL column in the base table(s) of the view.
//          Use the INSERT or UPDATE commands to modify the base tables(s);
//          consequently, this modifies the view.
12408, 00000, "tablespace previously existed at another label (%s)"
// *Cause: A tablespace by this name was previously created and dropped
//         at another label.  Part of the dictionary entry for the old
//         tablespace remains, and the new tablespace is attempting to
//         reuse the old entry.
// *Action: Either recreate the tablespace at the original label or
//          choose a new name for this tablespace.
12409, 00000, "DBLOW cannot be null in DBMS MAC mode"
// *Cause: The database was started in DBMS MAC mode before resetting DBLOW.
// *Action: Restart the database in OS MAC mode and supply valid values for
//          both DBHIGH and DBLOW before starting up in DBMS MAC mode.
12410, 00000, "DBHIGH cannot be null in DBMS MAC mode"
// *Cause: The database was started in DBMS MAC mode before resetting DBHIGH.
// *Action: Restart the database in OS MAC mode and supply valid values for
//          both DBHIGH and DBLOW before starting up in DBMS MAC mode.
12411, 00000, "DBHIGH must dominate DBLOW"
// *Cause: DBHIGH does not dominate DBLOW.
// *Action: Restart the database in OS MAC mode and supply valid values
//          for DBHIGH and DBLOW before starting up in DBMS MAC mode.
12412, 00000, "Cannot raise DBLOW above %s"
// *Cause:  You tried raise DBLOW above its current value.  DBLOW can only
//          be lowered;  it cannot be raised.
// *Action: Do not attempt to raise DBLOW.
12413, 00000, "Cannot lower DBHIGH below %s"
// *Cause:  You tried to lower DBHIGH below its current value.  DBHIGH
//          can only be raised.
// *Action: Do not attempt to lower DBHIGH.
12414, 00000, "must be DBHIGH (%s) to startup database"
// *Cause: You tried to open a database while at an OS label not equal
//         to DBHIGH.
// *Action: Login at DBHIGH to start the database.
12415, 00000, "session label must dominate the creation label of role %s"
// *Cause:  You tried to grant a privilege to a role while at a label
//          that does not dominate the role's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the role's creation label in order
//          to grant a privilege to the role.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the role and perform the grant
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of the role.
12416, 00000, "label of audit must dominate user"
// *Cause:  You tried to set statement audit options for a user while at a
//          label that does not dominate the user's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the user's creation label in order
//          to set statement audit options for the user.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the user and set the statement
//          audit option while at a label that dominates the creation
//          label of the user.
12418, 00000, "label of index must equal table"
// *Cause:  You tried to create an index on a table while at a label that
//          does not match the table's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the table's creation label in order
//          to create an index on the table.  If the table was created at
//          DBHIGH or DBLOW, your label must be set to DBHIGH or DBLOW.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the table and create the index
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the table.
12419, 00000, "label of column must equal table"
// *Cause:  You tried to add a column to a table while at a label that
//          does not match the table's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the table's creation label in order
//          to add a column to the table.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the table and add the column
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the table.
12420, 00000, "label of stored object must dominate referenced object %s"
// *Cause: You tried to create or you issued a statement that tried
//         to create a stored object (view, procedure, function,
//         trigger) which references some object while at a label
//         that does not dominate the referenced object's creation label.
//         Your DBMS label must dominate the creation labels of all
//         referenced objects in order to create a stored object.
//         While the referenced object may be visible due to enabled
//         MAC privileges, MAC privileges cannot be used to 
//         create the stored object.
// *Action: Check the creation labels of the referenced objects and
//          create the stored object while at a label that dominates
//          the creation labels of all referenced objects.
12421, 00000, "label of grant must dominate object"
// *Cause:  You tried to grant privileges on an object while at a label
//          that does not dominate the object's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the object's creation label
//          in order to grant privileges on the object.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the object and perform the grant
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of the object.
12422, 00000, "label of grant must dominate grantee %s"
// *Cause:  You tried to grant privileges to a user while at a label that
//          does not dominate the user's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the user's creation label
//          in order to grant privileges to the user.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the user and grant the privileges
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of the user.
12423, 00000, "label of constraint must equal table"
// *Cause:  You tried to add a constraint to a table while at a label
//          that does not match the table's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the creation label of the table
//          in order to add a constraint to the table.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the table and add the constraint
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the table.
12424, 00000, "label of object must dominate tablespace"
// *Cause:  You tried to create an object in a tablespace while at
//          a label that does not dominate the tablespace's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the tablespace's creation label
//          in order to create an object in the tablespace.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the tablespace and create the object
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of
//          the tablespace.
12425, 00000, "label of table must dominate cluster"
// *Cause:  You tried to create a table in a cluster while at a label
//          that does not dominate the cluster's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the cluster's creation label
//          in order to create a table in the cluster.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the cluster and create the table
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of the cluster.
12426, 00000, "label of user must dominate default or temporary tablespace"
// *Cause:  You tried to assign a user a default or temporary tablespace
//          when the user's creation label did not dominate the tablespace's
//          creation label.  The user's creation label must dominate the
//          tablespace's creation label in order for the default or temporary
//          tablespace to be assigned to the user.  Your DBMS label must
//          dominate both the user's and the tablespace's creation labels
//          in order to assign the tablespace to the user.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the default or temporary tablespaces
//          and create the user so that the user's creation label
//          dominates the creation label of the tablespaces.
12427, 00000, "label of object must dominate schema"
// *Cause:  You tried to create an object in a schema while at a label
//          that does not dominate the schema's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must dominate the schema's creation label in
//          order to create an object in the schema.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the schema and create the object
//          while at a label that dominates the creation label of the schema.
12428, 00000, "insufficient MAC privileges"
// *Cause: You tried to write to an object when you did not have
//         sufficient privileges.  You may have sufficient privileges
//         to read the object, but do not have MAC write access to
//         the object.
// *Action: Either retry the operation at the label of the object or
//         ask the database administrator for sufficient MAC privileges
//         to write the object.  See the Trusted ORACLE7 Server
//         Administrator's Guide for more information on MAC privileges.
12429, 00000, "label of comment must equal table or view"
// *Cause:  You tried to comment a table or view while at a label that does
//          not match the table's or view's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the table's or view's creation
//          label in order to comment the table or view.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the table or view and add the comment
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the table
//          or view.
12430, 00000, "label of trigger must equal table"
// *Cause: You tried to create or you issued a statement that tried 
//         to create a trigger on a table while at a label
//         that does not match the table's creation label.
//         Your DBMS label must match the table's creation label in
//         order to create the trigger on the table.
//         While the table may be visible due to enabled MAC privileges,
//         MAC privileges cannot be used to create a trigger.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the table and create the trigger
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the table.
12431, 00000, "label of user must dominate default profile"
// *Cause:  You tried to assign a user a default profile when the
//          user's creation label did not dominate the default
//          profile's creation label.  In order to assign a default profile to
//          a user, the user's creation label must
//          dominate the default profile's creation label. Your DBMS
//          label must dominate both the user's and the default profile's
//          creation labels in order to assign the user the default profile.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the default profile and create the
//          user so that the user's creation label dominates the creation
//          label of the default profile.
12432, 00000, "label of grant must equal label of procedure"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to assign MAC privileges to a procedure at
//          a label other than the creation label of the procedure.
// *Action: Grant MAC privileges to the procedure at the procedure's creation
//          label.
12433, 00000, "label of default role %s must dominate user"
// *Cause:  You tried to assign a default role to a user when the default
//          role's creation label did not dominate the user's creation label.
//          The default role's creation label must dominate the user's
//          creation label.  Your DBMS label also must dominate both the
//          role's and user's creation label in order to assign a user a role.
// *Action: Check the creation labels of the user and role and assign
//          only those roles whose creation labels dominate the creation
//          label of the user.
12434, 00000, "label of child record must dominate parent"
// *Cause:  You tried to insert a child record with a label that
//          does not dominate the corresponding parent record's label or
//          update a parent record such that the child records would not
//          dominate the corresponding parent's label.  The label of a child
//          record must always dominate that of its parent record.
// *Action: Check the label of the parent record and insert the child
//          record while at a label that dominates the label of the
//          parent record or update the label of the child record before
//          updating the parent record so that the child can still dominate
//          the parent after the update.
12435, 00000, "label of package body must equal package"
// *Cause:  You tried to create a package body while at a label that does
//          not match the corresponding package's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the package's creation label in
//          order to create a package body.
// *Action: Check the creation label of the package and create the package body
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the package.
12436, 00000, "package body must exist to grant MAC privileges"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to grant MAC privileges to a package when the
//          package body does not exist.
// *Action: Create the package body for the package and then re-attempt
//          the grant.
12437, 00000, "cannot write down to a database at a lower label"
// *Cause:  You tried to perform a write operation in a secondary database.
//          You can only perform write operations in your primary database.
// *Action: Connect directly to the secondary database to perform the 
//          operation.
12438, 00000, "insufficient privileges to validate constraint on all rows"
// *Cause:  You must have access to all rows in a table in order to attempt
//          to enable a constraint.
// *Action: Either enable MAC privileges so that you can read all rows in 
//          the table, or downgrade all rows in the table so you can read them.
//          Then enable the constraint.
12439, 00000, "cannot modify ROWLABEL column"
// *Cause:  You tried to modify the definition of the ROWLABEL column with
//          the ALTER command.  For example, you may have tried to lengthen
//          the ROWLABEL column.
// *Action: Although the value of the ROWLABEL column can be changed, the
//          ROWLABEL column definition cannot be modified.
12440, 00000, "database has not been mounted in read-compatible mode"
// *Cause:  The requested secondary database was not started in
//          read-compatible mode.  In order for a database to be mounted by
//          a higher level read-secure instance, the database must be mounted
//          by its primary instance in read-compatible mode.
// *Action: Set the DB_MOUNT_MODE parameter to READ_COMPATIBLE in the
//          secondary database and start up the secondary database.
12441, 00000, "grant already exists at a different label"
// *Cause:  You tried to grant a privilege that was previously granted at a
//          different label.
// *Action: Check USER_SYS_GRANTS or USER_OBJ_GRANTS to identify the
//          label of the privilege's previous grant.  If you want to execute
//          the grant at the new label, revoke the old grant
//          and regrant the privilege while at the new label.
12442, 00000, "must be at same label as user to modify default roles"
// *Cause:  You tried to modify a user's default roles while at a
//          label that does not match the user's creation label.
//          Your DBMS label must match the user's creation label in
//          order to alter a user.
// *Action: Check the ALL_USERS view to determine the creation
//          label of the user and modify the user's default roles
//          while at a label that matches the creation label of the user.
12443, 00000, "audit option already exists at a different label"
// *Cause:  You tried to audit an event that was previously audited at a
//          different label.
// *Action: Check the DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS or DBA_PRIV_AUDIT_OPTS dictionary
//          views to identify the label of the previous audit statement. If
//          you want to audit the event at the new label, stop the old
//          audit (using the NOAUDIT statement) and re-audit the event
//          while at the new label.
12444, 00000, "file label is lower than instance label"
// *Cause:  You tried to reuse a file with a label different than the database
//          instance label.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for the file name.  Remove the file
//          or relabel it to match the database instance label.
12445, 00000, "index/row label mismatch - see trace file"
// *Cause:  
// *Action: 
12446, 00000, "file label is higher than instance label"
// *Cause:  You tried to reuse a file with a label different than the database
//          instance label.  You can only reuse files labeled at or below the
//          instance label.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for the file name.  Remove the file
//          or relabel it to match the database instance label.
12447, 00000, "non-secure protocol used;  connection denied"
// *Cause:  You tried to connect to Trusted ORACLE7 with a networking protocol
//          that was not secure.  You must use a secure networking protocol to
//          connect via a remote location.
// *Action: Either connect to the database with a secure networking protocol or
//          log in directly to the database.
12448, 00000, "greatest lower bound resulted in an invalid operating system label"
// *Cause:  You tried to do an operation that generated a greatest lower
//          bound (GLB) label which is not a valid label on your operating
//          system.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for a more specific messages.  See
//          your installation or user's guide for information on invalid
//          label generation.  See the Trusted ORACLE7 Server Administrator's
//          Guide for information on greatest lower bound (GLB) functions.
12449, 00000, "least upper bound resulted in an invalid operating system label"
// *Cause:  You tried to do an operation that generated a least upper bound
//          (LUB) label which is not a valid label on your operating system.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for a more specific messages.  See
//          your installation or user's guide for information on invalid
//          label generation.  See the Trusted ORACLE7 Server Administrator's
//          Guide for information on least upper bound (LUB) functions.
12450, 00000, "internal buffer overflow during label translation"
// *Cause:  An internal buffer used to translate labels overflowed.  A possible
//          cause could be a format mask you specified is too large.
// *Action: Try using a smaller format mask.
12451, 00000, "format mask for TO_LABEL or TO_CHAR function is invalid"
// *Cause:  The format mask that you specified did not contain valid format
//          codes for label conversion.
// *Action: Check the Trusted ORACLE7 Server Administrators Guide for valid
//          format codes.  Correct the format mask and reattemopt the
//          operation.
12452, 00000, "error initializing label context"
// *Cause:  An internal error occurred that prevented initialization of the
//          label context.  This may be caused by internal memory corruption
//          or a software defect.
// *Action: Please contact Oracle WorldWide Technical Support.
12453, 00000, "binary label could not be translated into a string"
// *Cause:  The binary label that you specified for conversion is not valid.
// *Action: Check the source of the binary label.  Execute the conversion
//          with a valid binary label.
12454, 00000, "input string does not contain expected punctuation or literal"
// *Cause:  The punctuation you supplied in the label string is inconsistent
//          with the format you specified.
// *Action:  Change the punctuation in the label string or format, whichever is
//           appropriate, and reissue the statement.
12455, 00000, "invalid internal format code found"
// *Cause:  In performing the requested translation, a format code was invalid.
//          This message may result from memory corruption.
// *Action: Please contact Oracle WorldWide Technical Support.
12456, 00000, "duplicate format code specified in string to label conversion"
// *Cause:  You may not specify duplicate string input when converting to
//          a binary label.  For example, 'SEN SENLEV' is an invalid format
//          mask.
// *Action: Change the format mask and input string to specify a format code
//          only once.
12457, 00000, "invalid length for MLSLABEL bind variable"
// *Cause:  A bind variable of type MLSLABEL is too long.
// *Action: Consult your documentation for proper datatype lengths.
12458, 00000, "the input string could not be translated into a binary label"
// *Cause:  The input string you specified is not a valid binary label on your
//          operating system.
// *Action: Check the input string, change any components so that they
//          form a valid label, and retry the operation.
12459, 00000, "maximum number of columns in a Trusted Oracle table is 253"
// *Cause:  A CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement tried to add more than 253
//          columns (not counting ROWLABEL) to a table.
// *Action: Specify no more than 253 columns in your CREATE or ALTER TABLE
//          command.
12460, 00000, "the value %s for the MLS_LABEL_FORMAT parameter is not valid"
// *Cause:  The value for the MLS_LABEL_FORMAT parameter you specified does not
//          contain a valid format mask.  You must have a valid
//          MLS_LABEL_FORMAT parameter for the database to start up.
// *Action: Change this parameter setting in your init.ora file to a correct
//          value.
12461, 00000, "invalid binary label"
// *Cause:  You provided a binary label in an OCI program's bind
//          statement that was not a valid operating system label.
// *Action: Replace the invalid binary label with one that is valid.
12470, 00000, "process label could not be found"
// *Cause:  An error was encountered in translating the your operating system
//          process label into a label number.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for a more specific message.
12475, 00000, "cannot log in below DBLOW (%s)"
// *Cause:  You attempted to log in at a label dominated by DBLOW.  You can
//          only log in to Trusted ORACLE between DBLOW and DBHIGH, inclusive.
// *Action: Either log in at a higher label, or lower DBLOW.
12476, 00000, "cannot log in above DBHIGH (%s)"
// *Cause:  You attempted to log in at a label dominating DBHIGH.  You can
//          only log in to Trusted ORACLE between DBLOW and DBHIGH, inclusive
// *Action: Either log in at a lower label, or raise DBHIGH.
12477, 00000, "cannot insert label below DBLOW (%s)"
// *Cause:  You tried to explicitly insert a value below DBLOW into the
//          ROWLABEL column, or tried to specify a value lower than DBLOW
//          in a column of datatype MLSLABEL.  Any label you insert into
//          Trusted ORACLE table must fall between DBLOW and DBHIGH, inclusive.
// *Action: Either lower the value of DBLOW, or specify a higher label on
//          the INSERT or UPDATE statement.
12478, 00000, "cannot insert label above DBHIGH (%s)"
// *Cause:  You tried to explicitly insert a value above DBHIGH into the
//          ROWLABEL column, or
//          tried to specify a value higher than DBHIGH in a column of
//          datatype MLSLABEL.  Any label you insert into a Trusted ORACLE
//          table must fall between DBLOW and DBHIGH, inclusive.
// *Action: Either raise the value of DBHIGH, or specify a lower label on the
//          INSERT or UPDATE statement.
12480, 00000, "secondary database changing between OS MAC and DBMS MAC modes"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to access a secondary database while the
//          secondary database was in the process of changing between OS MAC
//          and DBMS MAC modes.
// *Action: Re-attempt the operation after the change is complete.
12485, 00000, "cannot find file label for %s"
// *Cause:  An error was encountered while reading the label of the specified
//          file.
// *Action: Examine the message stack for an operating system message.
12487, 00000, "insufficient privileges to set label to DBHIGH or DBLOW"
// *Cause:  You must connect to Trusted ORACLE using the INTERNAL keyword
//          in order to set your label to DBHIGH or DBLOW.
// *Action: Connect to Trusted ORACLE using INTERNAL, then set your label to
//          DBHIGH or DBLOW.  If you do not have privileges to connect using
//          INTERNAL, contact your database administrator.
12488, 00000, "session label must be equal to %s"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to log in to an OS MAC database at other than
//          the database label.
// *Action: Log in from an OS process at the specified label.
12489, 00000, "insufficient MAC privileges to alter your session label"
// *Cause:  You tried to alter your session label without the appropriate
//          MAC privileges.  You must have the appropriate MAC privileges
//          in order to dynamically change your session label.  Note that
//          MAC privileges are not available in an OS MAC database, only in
//          a DBMS MAC database.
// *Action: To change your session label, do one of the following:
//          *   Change your operating system label.  This is your
//              only alternative in OS MAC mode.  This can be done by
//              logging out of the DBMS, changing your operating system label
//              within the operating system, and then logging back into the
//              DBMS.  Note that, if you are logging into an OS MAC database,
//              your operating system label must match the label of your
//              primary database.
//          *   Obtain the appropriate MAC privileges that allow you to
//              dynamically change your session label within the DBMS.
//              You need the READUP and WRITEUP MAC privileges to raise
//              your session label, and the WRITEDOWN MAC privilege
//              to lower your label, and all three to alter your
//              label laterally.  Note that changing your session label
//              does not effect your operating sysem label.
12490, 00000, "cannot alter DBMS label below username creation label (%s)"
// *Cause:  You attempted to alter your DBMS label to a label lower than
//          that at which your username was created.  You can only alter 
//          your DBMS label between your username's creation label and 
//          DBHIGH, within the limits of your clearance.
// *Action: Either do not alter your DBMS label below the specified label,
//          or contact the database administrator to recreate your username at
//          lower level.
12491, 00000, "cannot change MAC mode when mounted in READ_COMPATIBLE mode"
// *Cause:  You tried to change between OS and DB MAC mode while the database
//          was mounted in READ_COMPATIBLE mode.
// *Action: Set the DB_MOUNT_MODE parameter to NORMAL and restart the
//          database.
12494, 00000, "cannot mount secondary database labeled above DBLOW"
// *Cause:  The secondary database that you attempted to mount is labeled above
//          DBLOW in the primary database.  You can only mount a secondary 
//          database if that DBHIGH in that database (or, in OS MAC mode, the 
//          label of the database) is lower than DBLOW in your primary 
//          database.
// *Action: Determine if you really want to establish a read-secure link
//          between the two databases.  If so, relabel the secondary database 
//          so that DBHIGH in the secondary database is lower than DBLOW in 
//          the primary database.
12495, 00000, "multi-threaded server cannot be used with Trusted Oracle"
// *Cause:  The MTS_DISPATCHERS parameter is set in the initialization file,
//          which initiated the configuration of the multi-threaded server. 
// *Action: Remove the MTS_DISPATCHERS parameter from the initialization file
//          and restart the instance.

// *Action: Look for sources of data corruption, perhaps including
// 	    deliberate tampering.
/
12657, 00000, "TNS:no algorithms installed"
// *Cause:  The near side of the connection required the use of a

//         group or priority group is no longer in use before dropping.
//
23333, 00000, "column \"%s\" is already part of a column group"
// *Cause: Attempted to add a column to a column group when the column was

//          for offline instantiation of snapshots.
//
23363, 00000, "mismatch of snap base table \"%s\" at master and snap site"
// *Cause:  The name of the base table of the snapshot at the master site

// *Cause:  Value of argument "max_missing" to routine "differences()" 
//          cannot be less than 1.  Value of argument "commit_rows" to
//          routines "differences()" and "rectify()" cannot be less than 1.
// *Action: Choose an integer value for those arguments to be 1 or greater.
//
23367, 00000, "table %s is missing the primary key"
// *Cause: Table specified in argument "oname1" or "oname2" in call
//         to "differences()" routine does not contain either a primary
//         key or a virtual primary key (defined through dbms_repcat package

// *Action: Make sure the tables specified have a primary key defined.
//
23368, 00000, "name %s cannot be null or the empty string"
// *Cause:   Argument "sname1," "sname2," "oname1," "oname2,"

23369, 00000, "value of \"%s\" argument cannot be null"
// *Cause:    Argument "max_missing" to "differences()" routine
//            cannot be NULL.
// *Action:   Legal values for "max_missing" are integers 1 or greater.
//
23370, 00000, "table %s and table %s are not shape equivalent (%s)"
// *Cause:  The tables specified are not shape equivalent, which means
//          intuitively that the number of columns, the names, their datatypes
//          and lengths are not the same. Specifically, problem is
//          in the parentheses and is one of the following: the number of
//          columns are not equal, datatypes of columns with
//          same name in different tables are different, lengths of
//          varchar2 and char columns are not equal, precision and
//          scale of number datatypes are not equal.
// *Action: Make sure the two tables being compared have the same
//          number of columns, same column names, and same datatypes.
//
23371, 00000, "column %s unknown in table %s"
// *Cause:   Some column in "array_columns" argument (or "column_list" argument)
//           to "differences()" routine does not correspond to a column in
//           the specified table.
// *Action:  Make sure that all the columns in either "array_columns" or
//           "column_list" are present in the specified table.
//
23372, 00000, "type %s in table %s is unsupported"
// *Cause:   Certain types in the table comparison utility are not supported.
// *Action:  Make sure that the types of columns in the tables to be compared
//           are the ones supported by symmetric replication.
//
23373, 00000, "object group %s does not exist"
// *Cause: The group name was null or misspelled, or the group does not
//         exist locally.
// *Action: Specify the group correctly, or create it with 
//          dbms_repcat.create_master_repgroup().
//
23374, 00000, "object group %s already exists"
// *Cause: The given database already replicates the given object group.
// *Action: Choose a different group or a different database.
//
23375, 00000, "feature is incompatible with database version at %s"
// *Cause: A feature not compatible with the specified database was used
// *Action: Set or raise the value of the "compatible" init.ora parameter

//
23376, 00000, "node %s is not compatible with replication version \"%s\""
// *Cause: A feature not compatible with the remote database was used
// *Action: Upgrade the remote database and retry the operation
//
23377, 00000, "bad name %s for missing_rows_oname1 argument"
// *Cause: An attempt was made to use the name of the reference site table
//         as the name of the missing_rows_oname1 argument.  
// *Action: Provide a separately created table with a different name for
//          missing_rows_oname1 argument. The separately created table will 
//          contain the differences between the tables being compared.
//
23378, 00000, "connection qualifier \"%s\" is not valid for object group %s"
// *Cause : The connection qualifier used in the database link for the 
//          specified object group does match the qualifier specified for
//          the group in create_master_repgroup.
// *Action: Use or create a database link which contains the correct connection
//          qualifier.
//
23379, 00000, "connection qualifier \"%s\" is too long"
// *Cause: The maximum length of a database link, including the connection
//         qualifier, is 128 bytes.
// *Action: Use a shorter connection qualifier, or shorten the name of
//          the database link
//
23380, 00000, "propagation mode \"%s\" is not valid"
// *Cause: The specified propagation is misspelled, or is not supported.
// *Action: Refer to the manual on replicated data for valid propagation modes.
//
23381, 00000, "generated object for base object %s.%s@%s does not exist"
// *Cause: The system generated object(s) for the specified base object
//         do not exist at the specified site. The current operation
//         requires the base object to have generated replication support.
// *Action: Ensure that the generated replication object(s) for the base
//          object exist and are valid at the specified site.
//          If the generated object(s) do not exist, then the procedure

// *Action: Provide a snapshot name that is in sys.snap$, all_snapshots
//         or user_snapshots.
//
23402, 00000, "refresh was aborted because of conflicts caused by deferred txns"
// *Cause: There are outstanding conflicts logged in the DefError table
//         at the snapshot's master.
// *Action: Resolve the conflicts in the master DefError table and
//         refresh again after the table is empty.  Alternatively,
//         refresh with refresh_after_errors set to TRUE, which
//         will proceed with the refresh even if there are conflicts
//         in the master's DefError table.  Proceeding despite conflicts 
//         can result with an updatable snapshot's changes appearing
//         to be temporarily lost (until a refresh succeeds after the
//         conflicts are resolved).
//
23403, 00000, "refresh group \"%s\".\"%s\" already exists"
// *Cause: Making a new refresh group when there is already a group of

// *Action: Choose a diifferent refresh group name.
//
23404, 00000, "refresh group \"%s\".\"%s\" does not exist" 
// *Cause: A refresh group name was given that is not in sys.rgroup$.
// *Action: Provide a refresh group name that is in sys.rgroup$ or dbs_rgroup.
//
23405, 00000, "refresh group number %s does not exist" 
// *Cause: A refresh group number was given that is not in sys.rgroup$.
// *Action: Provide a refresh group number that is in sys.rgroup$ or dbs_rgroup.
//
23406, 00000, "insufficient privileges on user \"%s\""
// *Cause: The caller is not the owner of the snapshot and does not have
//         ALTER ANY SNAPSHOT privileges.
// *Action: Perform the operation as the owner of the snapshot or as a
//         user with ALTER ANY SNAPSHOT privileges.
//
23407, 00000, "object name %s must be shaped like \"schema\".\"object\" or \"object\""
// *Cause: The object name (e.g., the rollback segment, the snapshot name,
//         the refresh group) was incorrectly specified.
// *Action: Retry the operation with the object name properly specified
//          (like "schema"."object" or "object")
//
23409, 00000, "could not find an unused refresh group number"
// *Cause: 1000 consecutive refresh group numbers, as defined by the
//         rgroupseq number, were already used by rows in sys.rgroup$.
// *Action: Alter the sequence number to be within a legal unused range
//          and destroy unneeded refresh groups.
//
23410, 00000, "snapshot \"%s\".\"%s\" is already in a refresh group"
// *Cause: A snapshot of the same name is already in a refresh group.
// *Action: Subtract the snapshot from the current refresh group and
//         add it to its new refresh group, or combine the two refresh 
//         groups into a single refresh group.
//
23411, 00000, "snapshot \"%s\".\"%s\" is not in refresh group \"%s\".\"%s\""

// *Cause: There is no job visible to the caller with the given job number.
// *Action: Choose the number of a job visible to the caller.
23422, 00000, "Oracle Server could not generate an unused job number"
// *Cause: Oracle Server could not generate a job number that was not used to
//         identify another job.
// *Action: Retry the operation.

// *Action: Make sure that the replicated object group is in the
//         state given in the error message.
//
23432, 00000, "master site %s already exists"
// *Cause: An attempt was made to instantiate a replicated object group
//         at a master site that was already a part of the object group.
// *Action: If you were trying to add this site, do nothing because it
//         already exists; otherwise, pick the name of another site,
//         and re-run the routine.
//
23433, 00000, "executing against wrong master site %s"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to execute the routine at a site
//          that is different from the site specified in the argument
//          of the routine.
// *Action: Provide an argument to the routine that correctly indicates
//          the site against which the routine should be executing.
//
23434, 00000, "master site %s not known for object group"
