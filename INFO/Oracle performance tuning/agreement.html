<font face="arial, helvetica" size=4>SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT FOR ITKNOWLEDGE</font>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2">This Subscriber Agreement (the "Agreement") sets forth the terms and
conditions of your ITKnowledge Subscription.  As a condition of subscribing
to ITKnowledge, you must accept the Agreement in its entirety. <BR>

<P>
PLEASE
REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AND INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE BY CLICKING
THE "I AGREE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT.  BY USING THIS SERVICE
AFTER CLICKING THE "I AGREE" BUTTON, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF

<B>GENERAL</B><BR>
ITKnowledge is an electronic information service (the "Service") operated

(currently located at www.ITKnowledge.com).  The Service offers Subscribers
access to information, software and other content owned or licensed by
EarthWeb and third-parties ("Content Providers").  "Subscriber" means any
person who establishes an authorized account ("Account") for access to and
use of the Service. Once you complete the registration process and click
the "I AGREE" button, you become a Subscriber.  By becoming a Subscriber
and using the Service, you are indicating that you are at least 18 years
old, and that you agree to be bound by all of the terms in this Agreement.
The right to use the Service is personal to you, and your Account is not
transferable.  You are encouraged to print and keep a copy of this
Agreement.  
<P>
<B>SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION</B><BR>
By clicking the "I AGREE" button, you agree that EarthWeb may store
information you provide as part of the registration process, as well as
usage information, and provide aggregate statistical information about
subscribers to advertisers, potential advertisers, and Content Providers.
In addition, EarthWeb may use or disclose to third parties certain personal
identifying information, such as your name, address and phone number,
unless you notify EarthWeb that you do not wish EarthWeb to use or disclose
such information.  EarthWeb may use such information to inform you about
other EarthWeb publications, products and services, unless you notify
EarthWeb that you do not wish to receive such information.  EarthWeb may

Notwithstanding the foregoing, EarthWeb will not disclose to third parties
your credit card  information except to the extent necessary to complete a

authorize EarthWeb to charge to the credit card account designated during
the registration process the then applicable monthly or annual Subscription
fee ("Subscription Fee"). Information on current Subscription Fees and
other charges can be found in the Subscription Plan Information section of
ITKnowledge.  Your monthly or annual Subscription shall be renewed
automatically unless you notify EarthWeb before the expiration of your
current Subscription period that you wish to cancel your Subscription at
the conclusion of such Subscription period.  You may send cancellation
requests to EarthWeb via the Account Information section of ITKnowledge.
Unless otherwise indicated, all renewals will be charged at the standard
Subscription Fee in effect at the time the fee becomes payable. You agree
to pay all sales, use, value-added, personal property or other governmental
tax or levy imposed on the fees paid by you hereunder, other than taxes
based on net income or profits of EarthWeb Inc.

Subscription to ITKnowledge prior to the expiration of Trial Period,
EarthWeb will automatically charge to your credit card the fees for the

ITKnowledge,  post-Trial Period Subscription Fees will be charged at the

credit card. Information on the credit cards accepted by EarthWeb is
