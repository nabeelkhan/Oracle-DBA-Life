</FONT></H2>
<P>I have always thought that a glossary and an index greatly enhance the value of a book. I have made it a priority to have a complete and accurate glossary and index. Enjoy.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>ad-hoc.</B>
<DD>From the Latin <I>this is</I>. This term is used to describe an impromptu or spontaneous action. Most commonly used in terms of an <I>ad-hoc query</I> to mean an <I>impromptu, simple query</I>.
<DT><B>aggregate functions.</B>
<DD>Functions that operate on the collection of values in a certain column. These operations include such things as <TT>SUM</TT>, <TT>COUNT</TT>, <TT>AVG</TT>, <TT>MAX</TT>, and so on.
<DT><B>Asynchronous I/O (AIO).</B>
<DD>Asynchronous I/O allows a process to submit an I/O and not have to wait for the response. Later, when the I/O is completed, an interrupt occurs or the process can check to see whether the I/O has completed. By using Asynchronous I/Os, the DBWR can manage multiple writes at once so that it is not starved waiting for I/Os to complete.
<DT><B>bandwidth.</B>
<DD>A term often associated with networks or computer busses. The bandwidth is the throughput capacity. The bandwidth of the bus is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred across the bus.
<DT><B>batch processing system.</B>
<DD>Used to perform large background jobs, usually within a certain specified time window.
<DT><B>BLOB (Binary Large Data).</B>
<DD>A large amount of binary data stored within an Oracle database. BLOB data can consist of audio, video, images, documents, and so on; it is usually stored as LONG data.
<DT><B>block.</B>
<DD>The smallest unit of storage in an Oracle database. The database block contains header information concerning the block itself as well as the data.
<DT><B>buffer.</B>
<DD>An amount of memory used to store data. A buffer stores data that is about to be used or that has just been used. In many cases, buffers are in-memory copies of data that is also on disk. Buffers can be used to hold copies of data for quick read access, they can be modified and written to disk, or they can be created in memory as temporary storage.
<BR>In Oracle, the database buffers of the SGA store the most recently used blocks of database data. The set of database block buffers is known as the <I>database buffer cache</I>. The buffers used to temporarily store redo entries until they can be written to disk are known as the <I>redo log buffers</I>.
<BR>A <I>clean buffer</I> is a buffer that has not been modified. Because this buffer has not been changed, it is not necessary for the DBWR to write this buffer to disk. A <I>dirty buffer</I> is a buffer that has been modified. It is the job of the DBWR to eventually write all dirty block buffers out to disk.
<DT><B>cache.</B>
<DD>A storage area used to provide fast access to data. In hardware terms, the cache is a small (relative to main RAM) amount of memory that is much faster than main memory. This memory is used to reduce the time it takes to reload frequently used data or instructions into the CPU. CPU chips themselves contain small amounts of memory built in as a cache.
<BR>In Oracle, the block buffers and shared pool are considered caches because they are used to store data and instructions for quick access. Caching is very effective in reducing the time it takes to retrieve frequently used data.
<BR>Caching usually works using a <I>least recently used</I> algorithm. Data that has not been used for a while is eventually released from the cache to make room for new data. If data is requested and is in the cache (a phenomenon called a <I>cache hit<
1000
/I>), the data is retrieved from the cache, avoiding having to retrieve it from memory or disk. Once the data has been accessed again, it is marked as recently used and put on the top of the cache list.
<DT><B>Cartesian products.</B>
<DD>The result of a join with no join condition. Each row in a table is matched with every row of another table.
<DT><B>checksum.</B>
<DD>A number calculated from the contents of a storage unit such as a file or data block. Using a mathematical formula, the checksum number is generated from data. Because it is highly unlikely that data corruption can occur in such a way that the checksum would remain the same, checksums are used to verify data integrity. Beginning with Oracle version 7.2, checksums can be enabled on both data blocks and redo blocks.
<DT><B>cluster (machine).</B>
<DD>A group of computers that together form a larger logical machine. Oracle clusters computers with the Oracle Parallel Server option.
<DT><B>cluster (table).</B>
<DD>A set of independent tables with a common column stored together. A cluster can improve performance by reducing I/Os and by preloading related data into the SGA before it is needed.
<DT><B>cluster index.</B>
<DD>The index on the cluster key. Each cluster key must have an index before data can be entered into the cluster.
<DT><B>cluster key.</B>
<DD>The common column in the set of tables built into a cluster. The cluster key must be indexed.
<DT><B>cold data.</B>
<DD>This term typically refers to infrequently used data. Cold data is rarely in cache because it is infrequently accessed.
<DT><B>cold database.</B>
<DD>This term typically refers to a database that is currently closed and not mounted. No users can connect to the database and no data files can be accessed.
<DT><B>collision.</B>
<DD>Typically refers to a network collision. A network collision occurs when two or more NICs try to use the network at the same time. When this happens, all the NICs must resend their data.
<DT><B>complex statements.</B>
<DD>An SQL statement that contains a subquery. The <I>subquery</I> is a query within the SQL statement used to determine values in the main or <I>parent</I> statement.
<DT><B>compound query.</B>
<DD>A query in which the set operators ( <TT>UNION</TT>, <TT>UNION ALL</TT>, <TT>INTERSECT</TT>, and <TT>MINUS</TT> ) are used to join two or more simple or complex statements. The individual statements in the compound query are referred to as <I>component queries</I>.
<DT><B>concurrency.</B>
<DD>The ability to perform concurrency defined many functions at the same time. Oracle provides for concurrency by allowing many users to access the database simultaneously.
<DT><B>consistent mode.</B>
<DD>In this mode, Oracle provides a consistent view of data from a certain point in time for the duration of the transaction. Until the transaction has completed, the data cannot change.
<DT><B>consistent read.</B>
<DD>A data access in consistent mode.
<DT><B>constraint.</B>
<DD>The mechanism that ensures that certain conditions relating columns and tables are maintained.
<DT><B>contention.</B>
<DD>A term usually used to describe a condition that occurs when two or more processes or threads attempt to obtain the same resource. The results of contention can vary depending on the resource in question.
<DT><B>cost-based optimizer.</B>
<DD>The Oracle optimizer that chooses an execution plan based on information and statistics that it has for tables, indexes, and clusters.
<DT><B>current mode.</B>
<DD>The mode in which Oracle provides a view as the data exists at this moment. Queries typically use consistent mode.
<DT><B>current read.</B>
<DD>A read in current mode; typically used for <TT>UPDATE</TT>, <TT>INSERT</TT>, and <TT>DELETE</TT> statements.
<DT><B>cursor.</B>
<DD>A handle to a specific private SQL area. You can think of a cursor as a pointer to or a name of a particular private SQL area.
<DT><B>data dictionary.</B>
<DD>A set of tables Oracle uses to maintain information about the database. The data dictionary contains information
1000
 about tables, indexes, clusters, and so on.
<DT><B>data warehouse.</B>
<DD>An extremely large warehouses, see data warehouses database made up of data from many sources to provide an information pool for business queries.
<DT><B>DBA (database administrator).</B>
<DD>The person responsible for the operation and configuration of the database. The DBA is the person responsible for the performance of the database. The DBA is charged with keeping the database operating smoothly, ensuring that backups are done on a regular basis (and that the backups work), and installing new software. Other responsibilities may include planning for future expansion and disk space needs; creating databases and tablespaces; adding users and maintaining security; and monitoring the database and retuning it as necessary. Large installations may have teams of DBAs to keep the system running smoothly; alternatively, the tasks may be segmented among the DBAs.
<DT><B>DDL (Data Definition Language) commands.</B>
<DD>The commands used in the creation and modification of schema objects. These commands include the ability to create, alter, and drop objects; grant and revoke privileges and roles; establish auditing options; and add comments to the data dictionary. These commands are all related to the management and administration of the Oracle database. Before and after each DDL statement, Oracle implicitly commits the current transaction.
<DT><B>deadlock.</B>
<DD>Deadlocks occur when two or more processes hold a resource that the other one needs. Neither of the processes will release its resource until it has received the other&#146;s resource; therefore, neither process can proceed.
<DT><B>decision support system.</B>
<DD>Characterized by large business queries designed to provide valuable data that is used to make sound business decisions.
<DT><B>deferred frame.</B>
<DD>A network frame delayed from transferring because the network is busy.
<DT><B><TT>DELETE</TT>.
</B>

If the data is not fed to the tape quickly enough, the tape drive must reposition the tape to wherever it last stopped recording data (to reposition the tape, the drive must stop the tape and rewind it). This action severely degrades performance.
<DT><B>stored function.</B>
<DD><I>See</I> function.
<DT><B>stored procedure.</B>
<DD
1000
><I>See</I> procedure.
<DT><B>subquery.</B>

<DT><B>swapping.</B>
<DD>An operating system function similar to paging; used to copy virtual memory between physical memory and the paging file (<I>see</I> virtual memory). Swapping is almost identical to paging except that swapping is done on a process basis and paging is done on a memory-page basis. Swapping is used when the amount of virtual memory in use has exceeded the amount of physical memory available. Swapping is quite expensive in terms of performance and should be avoided if possible.
<DT><B>synonym.</B>
<DD>An alias for a table, view, sequence, or program unit.
<DT><B>System Global Area.</B>
<DD>A shared memory region Oracle uses to store data and control information for one Oracle instance. The SGA is allocated when the Oracle instance starts; it is deallocated when the Oracle instance shuts down. Each Oracle instance that starts has its own SGA. The information in the SGA is made up of the database buffers, the redo log buffer, and the shared pool; each has a fixed size and is created at instance startup.
<DT><B>table.</B>
<DD>The basic unit of storage in the Oracle database. Users store their data in tables.
<DT><B>tablespace.</B>
<DD>A logical structure that consists of one or more data files. A tablespace is used to logically contain tables, clusters, and indexes.
<DT><B>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).</B>
<DD>A network protocol. TCP/IP is probably the most used network protocol in the world.
<DT><B>thread.</B>
<DD>Sometimes know as a <I>lightweight process</I>. Similar to a process but shares the process context with other threads. A thread has much less overhead associated with it than does a normal process. A <I>thread switch</I> (change between threads) has much less overhead than a process switch.
<DT><B>Token Ring.</B>
<DD>A hardware network standard. Token Ring networks use a token-passing mechanism for arbitration. Only the NIC with the token can use the network.
<DT><B>transaction.</B>
<DD>A set of database statements that represents a logical unit of work or function. A database transaction starts when the first SQL statement is submitted and ends when the commit or rollback has occurred. Performance measurements (such as those described in Chapter 5, &#147;Benchmarking,&#148; often uses the number of transactions per second as the performance metric.
<DT><B>trigger.</B>
<DD>A mechanism that allows you to write procedures that are automatically executed whenever an <TT>INSERT</TT>, <TT>UPDATE</TT>, or <TT>DELETE</TT> statement is executed on a table or view. Triggers can be used to enforce integrity constraints or automate some other custom function.
<DT><B>two-phase commit.</B>
<DD>The process by which distributed transactions occur. In a two-phase commit, each node commits its changes and signals that it has completed. When all nodes have successfully committed, the distributed transaction has committed.
<DT><B><TT>UPDATE</TT>.
</B>
<DD>The SQL statement used to change rows in a table.
<DT><B>view.</B>
<DD>A window into a table or set of tables. A view is a way for a table or set of tables to be seen. A view, like a table, can be queried, updated, inserted into, and deleted from. The data, however, is actually stored in the tables to which the view refers. <DT><B>virtual memory.</B>
<DD>The memory that can be used for programs in the operating system. To overcome the limitations associated with insufficient physical memory, virtual memory allows programs to run that are larger than the amount of physical memory in the system. When there is not enough physical memory in the system, these programs are copied from RAM to a disk file called a <I>paging</I> or <I>swap file</I>. This arrangement allows small systems to run many programs. There is a performance penalty you pay when the computer pages or swaps.
