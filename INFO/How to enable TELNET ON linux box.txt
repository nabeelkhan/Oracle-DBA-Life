How to enable TELNET ON linux box

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/227074

a) Check if its installed

Typing commands
>which telnet
shows
/usr/kerberos/bin/telnet
and
>which ftp
shows
/usr/kerberos/bin/ftp


I tried >ftp linuxboxname
and get
ftp: connect: connection refused

telnet from the linux box to self gives
trying 192.168.2.4...
telnet: unable to connect to remote host: connection refused

b) Go to /etc/xinetd.d

c) edit krb5-telnet to change disable = yes to no

d) restart service

service xinetd restart
