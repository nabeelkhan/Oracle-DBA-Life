Scripts for the Oracle9i DBA Handbook, by Kevin Loney and Marlene 
Theriault, copyright Osborne/McGraw-Hill


The scripts are all available as plain ASCII text files so you can 
easily copy them to the operating platform of your choice.  The 
scripts are compiled into files on a chapter-by-chapter basis. 
There is one file per chapter.  The scripts are shown in the order 
in which they occur in the chapter. There are no scripts associated 
with the appendix.

For details on the use of the scripts and interpretation of the output,
see the appropriate chapter of this book.  The scripts are shown without 
of the accompanying text.  The scripts are provided here to simplify your 
testing and development process.  Some of the scripts contain variables 
whose values you will need to change prior to running the commands. 

The online versions of these files will be updated as the book is updated, 
and as corrections are implemented.  Errata will be posted at 
http://www.kevinloney.com and will be fixed in later printings.
