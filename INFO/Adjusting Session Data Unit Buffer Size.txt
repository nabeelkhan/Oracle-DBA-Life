Adjusting Session Data Unit Buffer Size
Before sending data across the network, Oracle Net buffers data into the Session Data Unit (SDU). It sends the data stored in this buffer when the buffer is full or when an application tries to read the data. When large amounts of data are being retrieved and when packet size is consistently the same, it might speed retrieval to adjust the default SDU size.

Optimal SDU size depends on the normal transport size. Use a sniffer to find out the frame size, or set tracing on to its highest level to check the number of packets sent and received and to determine whether they are fragmented. Tune your system to limit the amount of fragmentation.

Use Oracle Net Configuration Assistant to configure a change to the default SDU size on both the client and the server; SDU size is generally the same on both.
