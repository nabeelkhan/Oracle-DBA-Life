By default in 10g Oracle Database uses the Flash recovery area, and this could be confiured according to retentions policy!


In mount stage run the following query:

SELECT substr(name, 1, 30) name, space_limit AS quota,
       space_used        AS used,
        space_reclaimable AS reclaimable,
        number_of_files   AS files
  FROM  v$recovery_file_dest ;

NAME                                QUOTA       USED RECLAIMABLE      FILES
------------------------------ ---------- ---------- ----------- ----------
/u05/flash_recovery_area       2147483648  130774528           0          3


The result will look like this... use the following command after setting up the SID

on NT

C:\> set oracle_sid=<your_sid_name>
C:\> rman target /

RMAN> CROSSCHECK ARCHIVELOG ALL;
RMAN> LIST EXPIRED ARCHIVELOG ALL;
RMAN> DELETE EXPIRED ARCHIVELOG ALL;


on Linux/Unix

[oracle@oracle2 ~]$ rman target /

RMAN> CROSSCHECK ARCHIVELOG ALL;

RMAN> Exit

Return to sqlplus and start the database then 

SQL> alter system archive log all;



If incase you need to free up the space from flash_recovery_area then move the files from flash_recovery_area to any empty directory and then delete the files using RMAN, then in RMAN catalog the new location by doin the following:


RMAN> CATALOG START WITH '/OVNNM_ARCS/';
