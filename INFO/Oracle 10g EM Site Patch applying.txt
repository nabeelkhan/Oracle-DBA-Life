UPDATE
=======

Hello Nabeel,

.
ACTION PLAN
============
I guess the best way is use scripts:
1.Write a sql script to logon as sysdba and shutdown the database and one for startup:
e.g.:
## up.sql
connect sys/<pw> as sysdba
startup
exit
## down.sql
connect sys/<pw> as sysdba
shutdown immediate
exit
.
2. Write a shell script which shutdown and/or startup the database:
e.g.:
# /bin/sh

echo Database shutdown
echo Set the environment variables
export ORACLE_HOME=...
export ORACLE_SID=....
....
echo Shutdown the database
$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus /nolog @<path>/down.sql
echo Database down
exit

# /bin/sh

echo Database start
echo Set the environment variables
export ORACLE_HOME=...
export ORACLE_SID=....
....
echo Start the database
$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus /nolog @<path>/up.sql
echo Database up
exit
3. Copy teh script to the nodes you like to shutdown and startup
4. Edit the script in step 4 and run the scripts ad the points you need running this 
script
